This ensures that even if an adversary gains physical access to the device, the data remains secure and inaccessible.</p>\n<p>One of the most critical aspects of any data protection feature is its ability to support recovery operations in case of failure. To enable BitLocker recovery, significant design changes were implemented in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). This led us to a pivotal question: did these changes introduce any new attack surfaces impacting BitLocker?</p>\n<p>Our recent research project - first presented at Black Hat USA 2025 and DEF CON 33 (2025) – set out to explore the WinRE attack surfaces impacting BitLocker: finding new vulnerabilities, developing exploits, implementing fixes and ultimately hardening and further securing both WinRE and BitLocker. The research resulted in new vulnerabilities identified in WinRE and its boot procedure – most of which fall into the class of logical vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we will share the research journey: we will begin with an overview of the WinRE architecture, followed by a retrospective analysis of the attack surfaces exposed with the introduction of BitLocker. We will then discuss our methodology for effectively researching and exploiting these exposed attack surfaces. We will reveal how we identified new vulnerabilities and developed exploits, enabling us to bypass BitLocker and extract the protected data.</p>\n<p>To conclude this blog post, we will outline countermeasure that you can apply today to further harden BitLocker and highlight our commitment to continue our proactive and continues security work around WinRE, BitLocker and the related components.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bitlocker-overview\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#bitlocker-overview\">#</a> <strong>BitLocker Overview</strong></h3>\n<p>BitLocker is a Windows security feature that provides data-at-rest protection for disk volumes. BitLocker protection is based on Full Volume Encryption (FVE) technology that once enabled, encrypts the target volume, protecting all the data stored on it. Users have the flexibility to choose which volumes to encrypt based on their specific needs. By default, BitLocker targets the OS volume, ensuring that all data within the OS environment is protected.</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Volume layout and BitLocker encryption</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWNUaDRJcQ?image-dimensions=915x303&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<h5 id=\"bitlocker-threat-model\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#bitlocker-threat-model\">#</a> <strong>BitLocker Threat Model</strong></h5>\n<p>BitLocker aims to defend against theft scenarios, where a thief steals your laptop, aiming to extract your sensitive information, compromise your machine and even backdoor it. Consequently, the BitLocker threat model assumes an attacker like a common thief -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Full physical access</li>\n<li>No advanced credentials (usernames, passwords, etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>BitLocker is one of the few Windows features that explicitly considers physical attackers in its threat model. Protecting against physical attacker significantly raises the bar for countermeasures, as these possess far greater capabilities than remote ones.</p>\n<h5 id=\"the-hidden-attack-surface-windows-recovery-environment-winre\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-hidden-attack-surface-windows-recovery-environment-winre\">#</a> <strong>The Hidden Attack Surface – Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)</strong></h5>\n<p>Naturally, BitLocker’s attack surfaces are shaped by interfaces accessible to an attacker fitting within the BitLocker threat model. As we examined the different interfaces one stood out – the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). Any BitLocker attacker can directly boot into WinRE by holding the Shift key while selecting “Restart” from the logon screen.</p>\n<p>Figure 2: Booting into WinRE from to logon screen</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LVl2MXJNaQ?image-dimensions=940x343&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>Given WinRE’s fit within the BitLocker threat model, the lack of prior research, and its high vulnerability potential, we decided to conduct security review focused on finding new vulnerabilities, exploiting them, fixing them, and hardening WinRE by mitigating common vulnerability and exploitation patterns. Our end goal was to increase the security and resiliency of both WinRE and BitLocker.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, let’s dive into the research journey.</p>\n<h3 id=\"winre-overview\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-overview\">#</a> <strong>WinRE Overview</strong></h3>\n<h5 id=\"winre-introduction\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-introduction\">#</a> <strong>WinRE Introduction</strong></h5>\n<p>WinRE is Windows’s recovery platform – it’s designed to recover from critical system issues such as startup failures, persistent crashes, BitLocker errors, and more.</p>\n<p>For example, if your machine crashes, WinRE is the component responsible for analyzing the issue, identifying corruption and resolving it by using its recovery tools.</p>\n<p>If you use Windows, chances are that you’ve encountered WinRE at least a few times in your lifetime.</p>\n<p>Figure 3: WinRE UI</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LVI1MlZ3Zw?image-dimensions=875x666&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<h5 id=\"winre-architecture\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-architecture\">#</a> <strong>WinRE Architecture</strong></h5>\n<p>Architecturally, WinRE operates with its own standalone OS, known as the Recovery OS. This Recovery OS is a lean version of Windows with recovery-specific customizations.</p>\n<p>The recovery customizations include a unique set of recovery tools that are integrated into the known blue screened recovery UI. Among the exposed recovery tools are familiar options such as Startup Repair, System Reset, System Restore, and others.</p>\n<p>For storage, the entire Recovery OS - including all executables, DLLs, and drivers - is compressed into a single WIM file named WinRE.wim, which is stored on disk.</p>\n<p>Figure 4: Recovery OS compression into WinRE.wim</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWowbllFeQ?image-dimensions=940x333&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>Then, when WinRE boots, the entire WIM file is decompressed from disk into RAM, creating a temporary RAM disk that hosts the Recovery OS runtime. Any changes made within this environment are not saved back to the original WinRE.wim file, making the Recovery OS runtime inherently volatile - modifications are discarded upon reboot.</p>\n<p>Figure 5: WinRE.wim RAM disk boot</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LU1mblhvSA?image-dimensions=940x386&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<h5 id=\"winre-bitlocker-design-changes\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-bitlocker-design-changes\">#</a> <strong>WinRE BitLocker Design Changes</strong></h5>\n<p>When BitLocker was first introduced, WinRE had to evolve to support recovery from BitLocker-related failures. This led to several architectural and design changes to enable that recovery functionality. Let’s briefly review these changes.</p>\n<h6 id=\"winre-design-change-1-winrewim-relocation\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-design-change-1-winrewim-relocation\">#</a> <strong>WinRE Design Change #1 – WinRE.wim Relocation</strong></h6>\n<p>The first design change focused on the location of the compressed Recovery OS –WinRE.wim. This file was moved from residing in the OS volume - now encrypted by BitLocker - to a dedicated unencrypted recovery volume.</p>\n<p>This change was required because WinRE must remain accessible in the event of BitLocker failures. If the OS volume is BitLocker-encrypted and becomes unreadable due to a decryption issue, placing WinRE on that volume would block recovery. Since WinRE is a critical component that must be available, it was moved to a separate recovery volume. This helps ensure it can function even if the OS volume is not accessible.</p>\n<p>Figure 6: WinRE.wim relocation</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LTRVc3Boeg?image-dimensions=940x467&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<h6 id=\"winre-design-change-2-trusted-wim-boot\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-design-change-2-trusted-wim-boot\">#</a> <strong>WinRE Design Change #2 – Trusted WIM Boot</strong></h6>\n<p>The second design change focused on the integrity of the WinRE.wim file. To support integrity verification of WinRE.wim, a feature called Trusted WIM Boot was introduced. It verifies WinRE’s integrity by comparing its hash to a known-trusted hash.</p>\n<p>If the hashes match - the OS volume is automatically unlocked. If hashes don’t match - the OS volume remains locked.</p>\n<p>Figure 7: Trusted WIM boot hash comparison</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LXAzOHU3OA?image-dimensions=940x184&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>The two states - auto-unlocked and locked - define the level of access WinRE has to the main OS. In the auto-unlocked state, WinRE has full access to the OS, whereas in the locked state, it has no access at all.</p>\n<p>This change was necessary because WinRE now resides on the unencrypted recovery volume and can no longer be blindly trusted. With Trusted WIM Boot, any unauthorized modification to WinRE.wim breaks its trust - effectively blocking any tempering.</p>\n<h6 id=\"winre-design-change-3-volumes-re-lock\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-design-change-3-volumes-re-lock\">#</a> <strong>WinRE Design Change #3 – Volumes Re-Lock</strong></h6>\n<p>The third design change focused on limiting recovery tools that are inherently risky to BitLocker. For example, among the exposed recovery tools is the Command Prompt. To prevent a scenario where an attacker abuses the command prompt to access BitLocker protected data, a volume re-lock functionality was added to WinRE. This functionality is triggered every time that a risky recovery tool is selected and it re-locks the OS volume. To re-gain access to the OS volume, the user must manually enter the BitLocker recovery key - otherwise, all contents remain completely inaccessible.</p>\n<p>Figure 8: WinRE UI Volumes Re-Lock Functionality</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LVY1NDZLSw?image-dimensions=940x143&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>For example, if an attacker launches the Command Prompt recovery tool without inserting the BitLocker recovery key, access to BitLocker-encrypted volumes will be denied, resulting in the following lock error:</p>\n<p>Figure 9: WinRE UI Volumes Re-Lock Demonstration</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LXJJalZwcA?image-dimensions=940x550&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<h5 id=\"winre-design-changes-summary\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-design-changes-summary\">#</a> <strong>WinRE Design Changes Summary</strong></h5>\n<p>To summarize the impact of the design changes, as long as WinRE.wim is trusted, and no risky recovery tools are triggered, the OS volume is auto-unlocked allowing WinRE to recover it without requiring any user intervention. In contrast, If WinRE.wim is modified without authorization or a risky recovery tool is triggered, the OS volume is re-locked, preventing WinRE from accessing it.</p>\n<h5 id=\"exposed-attack-surfaces\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#exposed-attack-surfaces\">#</a> <strong>Exposed Attack Surfaces</strong></h5>\n<p>So now the critical question arises – were any attack surfaces exposed because of these design adjustments?</p>\n<p>As it turned out, during the auto-unlock state, WinRE parses files from unprotected volumes - specifically the EFI volume and the recovery volume.</p>\n<p>Figure 10: WinRE parsing files from unprotected volumes</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWExTVhvSw?image-dimensions=940x430&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>This parsing presents a very interesting attack surface, which wasn’t valuable to explore before BitLocker’s introduction – since there was no security boundary to cross. Before BitLocker, even full code execution within WinRE didn’t grant a physical attacker any new capabilities. In contrast, with BitLocker, any code execution within WinRE during the auto-unlock state can be utilized to bypass BitLocker and extract all the protected secrets.</p>\n<h5 id=\"this-blog-focus\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#this-blog-focus\">#</a> <strong>This Blog Focus</strong></h5>\n<p>In this blog, we will focus on exploring 3 such external files –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Boot.sdi – located on the recovery volume</li>\n<li>ReAgent.xml – located on the recovery volume</li>\n<li>Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store – located on the EFI volume</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Figure 11: Files focused on this blog post</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LVNEbkh6dQ?image-dimensions=940x504&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>The rest of this blog post will be focused on attacking the parsers of each of these files.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attacking-bootsdi-parsing\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#attacking-bootsdi-parsing\">#</a> <strong>Attacking Boot.sdi Parsing</strong></h3>\n<p>The SDI extension stands for System Deployment Image. SDI files are optionally used when booting from RAM disk.</p>\n<p>RAM disk boot is the procedure of extracting and creating a RAM-based disk from a static OS image. Unlike traditional boot scenarios where the OS disk is on a physical storage, in this case, the OS disk is entirely in RAM. Subsequently, disk I/O requests are routed to the RAM disk instead of the physical storage.</p>\n<p>One example of RAM disk boot is WinRE boot – where WinRE.wim is the static OS image.</p>\n<p>Figure 12: RAM disk boot demonstration</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUhONnJ3aA?image-dimensions=940x318&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>In terms of SDI usage - when specified, the SDI file gets prepended to the virtual disk within the allocated RAM disk memory region.</p>\n<p>Figure 13: RAM disk buffer layout with an SDI file</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUlpUkxyRg?image-dimensions=886x842&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>The SDI file format primarily consists of binary blobs, organized through a “blob table” that holds metadata for each blob, including its type, size and relative offset within the file. While we won’t delve into the full SDI format, we’ll focus on the specific blobs specified in the SDI when used to boot WinRE.wim:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>WIM blob – a blob describing the WIM image</li>\n<li>NTFS blob – a blob describing an NTFS volume</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Below is a demonstration of the entire RAM disk buffer layout. First, the SDI file, containing a WIM blob which points to the WinRE.wim file, and an NTFS blob which points to an empty NTFS volume.</p>\n<p>Figure 14: RAM disk buffer layout in WinRE.wim boot</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LVdBRDJvTw?image-dimensions=940x664&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>At this stage, you might wonder why an empty NTFS volume is necessary. It's required to maintain compatibility with Windows components that cannot operate directly on a WIM volume as the OS volume. The empty NTFS volume allows the WIM volume to be presented as a standard NTFS volume, enabling seamless interaction with Windows components that cannot operate directly on WIM volumes.</p>\n<p>With better understanding of the SDI file, and the overall RAM disk boot procedure, let’s take a closer look at the code responsible for the RAM disk loading.</p>\n<p>Figure 15: RAM Disk loading pseudo code</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUN5UlpuRA?image-dimensions=940x639&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>The code first allocates the RAM disk buffer large enough for both the SDI and WIM files. Then, it loads the SDI file into the allocated buffer. Then, it loads the WIM file into the allocated buffer, following the SDI. The loading API calculates the hash of the loaded WIM file, and this hash is later used as part of the Trusted WIM boot integrity verification. Lastly, the address of the WIM to boot from is calculated by adding the SDI WIM blob specified offset to the start of the RAM disk buffer. <strong>Notably, there is no correlation linking between the verified hashed WIM, and the booted WIM.</strong> The lack of correlation allows setting the WIM offset arbitrarily.</p>\n<p>Since we can set the WIM offset arbitrarily, we can append an untrusted WIM to the SDI file and adjust the WIM offset accordingly.</p>\n<p>As Trusted WIM boot hash verification uses the hash of the WIM on stored disk rather than the one indicated by the SDI WIM offset, the hash verification will succeed - because the trusted WIM on disk remains unchanged. However, the system will boot using the untrusted WIM specified by the SDI WIM offset.</p>\n<p>Below is a demonstration of the entire RAM disk buffer layout the exploitation scenario.</p>\n<p>Figure 16: RAM disk buffer layout in exploitation scenario</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUtQckVzMA?image-dimensions=940x690&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>This vulnerability allows bypassing the Trusted WIM boot verification – we can boot an untrusted WIM as trusted, and have our untrusted WIM benefit the auto-unlock functionality – thereby bypassing BitLocker and extracting the secrets.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate secrets extraction, we created a clone of WinRE.wim with and changed its launch app to the Command Prompt, instead of the recovery environment program. Then, appended this WIM to Boot.sdi, verified offsets are correct, and booted into WinRE. The result was the Command Prompt being launched in auto-unlock state.</p>\n<p>Figure 17: Demo – cmd.exe in auto-unlock – launched from untrusted WIM</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LU9QRlVlSw?image-dimensions=940x501&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>This vulnerability was patched in 2025’s July Patch Tuesday and received the ID of <strong>CVE-2025-48804</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attacking-reagentxml-parsing\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#attacking-reagentxml-parsing\">#</a> <strong>Attacking ReAgent.xml Parsing</strong></h3>\n<p>The ReAgent.xml file represents the current recovery state and configuration of WinRE.</p>\n<p>Figure 18: ReAgent.xml</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LU1Ta1BtOQ?image-dimensions=940x445&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>In the early stages of WinRE runtime, it parses this XML file.</p>\n<h5 id=\"reagentxml-scheduled-operations\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#reagentxml-scheduled-operations\">#</a> <strong>ReAgent.xml Scheduled Operations</strong></h5>\n<p>Among the interesting fields in the XML file is the “ScheduledOperation” field. This field instructs WinRE to run a recovery operation by ID. The supported operations include the known recovery tools such as startup repair, system reset and others.</p>\n<p>Simply, scheduled operations offer an alternative method to execute recovery tools in WinRE. As opposed to the known execution method, which is triggered manually through the WinRE UI, scheduled operations, if specified, execute automatically before the UI is displayed.</p>\n<p>Additionally, risky scheduled operations (e.g. Command Prompt), would trigger the re-lock functionality.</p>\n<p>Figure 19: Scheduled Operations</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LVlCQjNqZA?image-dimensions=940x116&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>In this blog post, we will focus on two scheduled operations –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Offline Scanning</li>\n<li>WinRE Apps</li>\n</ol>\n<h5 id=\"offline-scanning-scheduled-operation\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#offline-scanning-scheduled-operation\">#</a> <strong>Offline Scanning Scheduled Operation</strong></h5>\n<p>The offline scanning scheduled operation allows running Anti-Virus scan from within WinRE against the OS volume. This functionality is beneficial against malware that does not persist in WinRE runtime.</p>\n<p>Figure 20: Offline Scanning Scheduled Operation Demonstration</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWtUY1MxMA?image-dimensions=925x396&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>To avoid misuse of this feature, which runs in the auto-unlock state, there are multiple limitations that narrow down the apps allowed to perform Offline Scanning –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Offline Scanning apps are executed from the offline OS volume</li>\n<li>Offline Scanning apps must be digitally signed by Microsoft or WHQL</li>\n<li>The digital signature must be embedded in the app (not catalog signed)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, a BitLocker attacker can’t insert his own signed app, as the OS volume is assumed BitLocker encrypted, and out of attacker’s reach.</p>\n<p>Figure 21: Offline Scanning App Execution and Limitations</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUxmNms4bw?image-dimensions=940x438&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>We enumerated the applicable apps and discovered approximately 30. No, the Command Prompt is not among them. Additionally, most of the applicable applications could not execute in WinRE mainly due to compatibility reasons.</p>\n<p>We reviewed allowed and applicable apps one by one to see if they could potentially be mis-used. That’s when we found that the tttracer.exe app fits within the limitation.</p>\n<p>Tttracer.exe is a time-travel debugging utility that supports tracing arbitrary apps. WinRE does not enforce strict validation of the Offline Scanning app arguments, which is reasonable given that each app may use a different argument format. As a result, it's possible to trace Command Prompt (cmd.exe) under tttracer.exe without triggering the re-lock functionality. The traced cmd.exe will benefit the auto-unlock functionality – thereby bypassing BitLocker and extracting the secrets.</p>\n<p>Figure 22: Exploiting the allowed tttracer.exe to proxy-execute cmd.exe</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LURPdlNBeg?image-dimensions=841x439&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>Figure 23: Demo – cmd.exe in auto-unlock - traced by tttracer.exe</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUNRNGVpUg?image-dimensions=940x501&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>This vulnerability was patched in 2025’s July Patch Tuesday and received the ID of <strong>CVE-2025-48800</strong>.</p>\n<h5 id=\"winre-apps-scheduled-operation\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#winre-apps-scheduled-operation\">#</a> <strong>WinRE Apps Scheduled Operation</strong></h5>\n<p>The WinRE apps scheduled operation simply allows running apps within WinRE. Specified apps are verified before benefiting from the auto-unlock functionality. Only those that pass verification can leverage auto-unlock, which is particularly useful for apps that require access to the BitLocker-encrypted OS volume.</p>\n<p>Figure 24: WinRE Apps Scheduled Operation Demonstration</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUM4a1V5WA?image-dimensions=940x211&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>The trust verification is based on a simple comparison of the executed app name and hash against a pre-defined list of allowed entries.</p>\n<p>The list of allowed entries is stored in the WinRE registry, which is part of the WinRE.wim file. Since WinRE.wim is integrity-protected by Trusted WIM boot verification, a BitLocker attacker cannot modify the registry to insert unauthorized entries - doing so would break the WIM trust.</p>\n<p>Figure 25: WinRE Apps Verification</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LVRnaTA4MA?image-dimensions=940x265&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>Similarly to the Offline Scanning operation research – we find that the verifications are implemented correctly, and we can’t directly execute our own custom apps. That said, the same question arises: any existing trusted apps that could be mis-used?</p>\n<p>We enumerated the allowed entries list and found one registered trusted app - SetupPlatform.exe. This app is registered as trusted during Windows Upgrade. Only once the upgrade is completed, the trusted app entry remains in the allowed list and is not removed.</p>\n<p>This adds SetupPlatform.exe as a potential attack surface, since it can be executed in the auto-unlock state.</p>\n<p>We then delve deeper into SetupPlatform.exe and found that it has an execution path that registers the Shift+F10 hotkey as cmd.exe launcher. When triggered, this hotkey launches cmd.exe without re-locking the OS volume. This mechanism is used to facilitate troubleshooting during upgrade failures.</p>\n<p>The first thing we tried to do is to schedule the SetupPlatform.exe WinRE app and see if we can trigger the Shift+F10 hotkey to interact with cmd.exe. We failed. It turned out that even though the desired execution path is triggered, it immediately exits due to missing configuration on the OS volume.</p>\n<p>Figure 26: SetupPlatform.exe execution flow</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LTdkSm1tag?image-dimensions=940x297&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, a BitLocker attacker can’t create the configuration, as the OS volume is assumed BitLocker encrypted, and out of attacker’s reach.</p>\n<p>The time window between the hotkey registration and the termination is too short, making it impossible to manually trigger.</p>\n<p>Figure 27: Impossible time Window</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUszUmxVdQ?image-dimensions=940x334&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>We decided to dig even deeper into SetupPlatform.exe, to see if other execution paths may help widening the short time window. That’s when we discovered an interesting flow. It turned out that after the hotkey registration, the app can spawn a blocking message box. The decision on whether to spawn this message box is based on an INI file that is searched for in the recovery volume, which is under out full control.</p>\n<p>Figure 28: Creating an infinite time window</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWhmR0V2Zw?image-dimensions=940x281&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>By configuring this INI file correctly, we can create an infinite time window that would allow triggering the Shift+F10 hotkey to launch and interact with cmd.exe. The launched cmd.exe will benefit the auto-unlock functionality – thereby bypassing BitLocker and extracting the secrets.</p>\n<p>Figure 29: Demo – cmd.exe in auto-unlock – launched via Shift+F10 hotkey</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUtPVEpDQg?image-dimensions=940x507&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>This vulnerability was patched in 2025’s July Patch Tuesday and received the ID of <strong>CVE-2025-48003</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"attacking-boot-configuration-data-bcd-parsing\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#attacking-boot-configuration-data-bcd-parsing\">#</a> <strong>Attacking Boot Configuration Data (BCD) Parsing</strong></h3>\n<p>BCD stands for Boot Configuration Data, and it’s the file that defines how Windows boots. It stores boot entries, controls the boot parameters, recovery settings and many more boot-related configurations.</p>\n<p>Figure 30: BCD store</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LXpudDJBVA?image-dimensions=940x623&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>In the context of WinRE, the usage of BCD is minimal - as most BCD parsing occurs during the boot phase - prior to the WinRE runtime.</p>\n<p>WinRE uses BCD mainly to determine the location of the target OS volume on disk, so that it knows which volume to aim the recovery operations to. Specifically, the OS device BCD element is the element queried by WinRE to calculate the target volume location. This element can point to any volume on disk, though by default, it points to the OS volume – commonly mapped to the C: drive.</p>\n<p>Figure 31: WinRE BCD Usage Demonstration</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWJ6cWR0Nw?image-dimensions=940x291&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>The first question that came into our minds when we investigated WinRE BCD usage, is what can we potentially gain from targeting BCD in the context of WinRE?</p>\n<p>As it turned out - WinRE fully trusts the target OS it recovers, and it sometimes queries sensitive configuration from that target OS, assuming it’s out of attacker’s reach. This assumption is solid from a design perspective, because with BitLocker enabled, the target OS is encrypted, and the attacker has no access whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Having said that, we wondered, can we challenge this assumption that target OS is out of attacker’s reach?</p>\n<h5 id=\"hunting-target-os-location-impersonation-primitive\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#hunting-target-os-location-impersonation-primitive\">#</a> <strong>Hunting Target OS Location Impersonation Primitive</strong></h5>\n<p>What if we could trick WinRE into thinking that an attacker-controlled volume is the trusted BitLocker-encrypted one? Our focus has shifted toward identifying a primitive that allows impersonation of the target OS location. The goal is to manipulate the osdevice element so that it points to an attacker-controlled volume - such as the Recovery volume - instead of pointing to the trusted, BitLocker-encrypted volume.</p>\n<p>This primitive, if gained, would break the trust assumption.</p>\n<p>Figure 32: Desired Primitive Demonstration</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LXl6M2ZaVg?image-dimensions=940x354&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>We already know that the OS device is controlled in the BCD store, which we can directly modify – as it resides on the EFI volume. One might think, why can’t you just change the device directly in the BCD?</p>\n<p>Well, theoretically, it’s possible, but it isn’t valuable. Let me explain - the OS device location isn’t used only by WinRE, but also by the Boot Manager – which uses it to know which volume it should auto-unlock. The challenge here is that the same store is used in both the boot and OS phases, so any change will affect both.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, modifying the OS device location to point to the Recovery volume prevents the Boot Manager from auto-unlocking the BitLocker-encrypted OS volume that contains the secrets. This is because the OS volume is no longer associated with the WinRE boot. While this scenario could theoretically break the trust assumption, it still wouldn’t allow extraction of BitLocker secrets - even with full code execution in WinRE.</p>\n<p>Figure 33: Directly Modifying OS device – not valuable</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWFRdENBcA?image-dimensions=940x333&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>Our primitive must not interfere with the boot procedure and the auto-unlock functionality. We must go deeper.</p>\n<p>We decided to dig deeper into the way WinRE searches for the BCD store. Any potential flaws at this stage wouldn’t interfere with the boot procedure or the auto-unlock functionality, as it occurs after the boot is completed.</p>\n<p>To locate the BCD store - WinRE iterates over disk volumes and searches each one for a BCD store. The first store found is the one used to further calculate the target OS location.</p>\n<p>Figure 34: WinRE BCD lookup logic demonstration</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWJnZGNNdg?image-dimensions=900x393&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>This volume iteration is an interesting point to further inspect – because only EFI volume contain the BCD store. Any attempt to locate the store on other volumes could be potentially abused.</p>\n<p>The functions used to iterate over volumes are <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstvolumew\">FindFirstVolume</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findnextvolumew\">FindNextVolume</a>. Notably, the remarks section highlights a very interesting point:</p>\n<p><em>“You should not assume any correlation between the order of the volumes that are returned by these functions and the order of the volumes that are on the computer. In particular, do not assume any correlation between volume order and drive letters as assigned by the BIOS (if any) or the Disk Administrator.”</em></p>\n<p>Under the hood, these functions perform further filtering which causes an inconsistency in the returned volume order.</p>\n<p>The typical volume order, returned by diskpart list vol command is as follows –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>OS volume</li>\n<li>EFI volume</li>\n<li>Recovery volume</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Figure 35: diskpart list vol command output</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUROamxIVQ?image-dimensions=940x180&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>However, the volume iteration functions would return a different order –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>OS volume</li>\n<li>Recovery volume</li>\n<li>EFI volume</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Can you spot the inconsistency? With the volume iteration functions, the Recovery volume is iterated over and checked for a BCD store before the EFI volume.</p>\n<p>By placing a custom, attacker-controlled store in the recovery volume – we can trick WinRE into using it, instead of using the boot store. With this setup, WinRE doesn’t even reach the point of querying the EFI volume.</p>\n<p>Figure 36: Exploiting the volume iteration order</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LXB0dUdDbA?image-dimensions=940x625&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>Any modification or corruption we make to that attacker store will only impact WinRE and will not disrupt the boot procedure at all!</p>\n<p>This flaw allows us to achieve the desired primitive: during the boot phase, the boot manager locates and uses a legitimate BCD store from the EFI volume to unlock BitLocker-encrypted OS volume. In the boot phase, there are no issues in the BCD store lookup logic.</p>\n<p>Figure 37: BCD usage in boot phase – EFI volume BCD store is used</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWFYMUZEVw?image-dimensions=940x262&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>However, during the OS phase, WinRE instead locates and uses the attacker-controlled BCD store in the recovery volume - leading it to recover an attacker-controlled volume.</p>\n<p>Figure 38: BCD usage in WinRE phase – Recovery volume BCD store is used</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LWc1WmJwZw?image-dimensions=940x280&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<h5 id=\"going-beyond-theoretical-concepts-exploitation-strategy\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#going-beyond-theoretical-concepts-exploitation-strategy\">#</a> <strong>Going Beyond Theoretical Concepts – Exploitation Strategy</strong></h5>\n<p>We successfully gained the desired primitive, but can it be further leveraged to extract BitLocker secrets?</p>\n<p>The reason we went after this primitive is because it allows us to break WinRE’s assumption that the target OS is out of attacker’s reach. However, given its novelty and unexplored exploitability, it was our responsibility to move beyond theoretical concepts and develop a fully functional exploit.</p>\n<p>To do so, we came up with the following exploitation strategy: Find a WinRE flow with two characteristics -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A flow that does not trigger the volumes re-lock functionality</li>\n<li>A flow that queries configuration from the target OS to perform operations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The idea is to chain this WinRE flow with the gained impersonation primitive – to trigger sensitive operations in the auto-unlock state.</p>\n<p>After exploring different WinRE behaviors, we found a potential candidate - the Push Button Reset (PBR) feature. PBR is Windows’s system reset tool, and it provides various reset functionalities.</p>\n<p>Figure 39: Push Button Reset Demonstration</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUpZcGEybA?image-dimensions=940x710&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>PBR supports multiple trigger modes, with one of its modes, known as “Online PBR” meeting the characteristics we defined for the exploit -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It does not trigger the re-lock functionality – thereby benefited the auto-unlock functionality</li>\n<li>It queries configuration from the target OS to perform sensitive operations – thereby can be controlled with the impersonation primitive</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Additionally, Online PBR can be scheduled freely through ReAgent.xml’s scheduled operations.</p>\n<p>With full control over the PBR configuration, the remaining task was to determine the exact sensitive directive required to extract BitLocker secrets. We found that the ResetSession.xml file - responsible for defining all operations executed by PBR - includes the DecryptVolume directive, which instructs PBR to decrypt any arbitrary BitLocker-encrypted volume -</p>\n<p>Figure 40: PBR ResetSession.xml BitLocker Volume Decryption</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LUMwemNIWQ?image-dimensions=940x287&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<h5 id=\"full-exploit-chain\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#full-exploit-chain\">#</a> <strong>Full Exploit Chain</strong></h5>\n<p>We now have all the pieces required for the full BitLocker bypass exploit chain. The exploit required creating and modifying few files on the Recovery volume -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The BCD store – with the OS device element pointing to the Recovery volume</li>\n<li>The PBR configuration – with the DecryptVolume PBR operation specifying the BitLocker-encrypted OS volume as the volume to decrypt</li>\n<li>The ReAgent.xml file – with Online PBR scheduled operation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Figure 41: Exploitation setup</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LVlndUFOdQ?image-dimensions=940x375&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>With this setup, the next WinRE boot will go through the Online PBR flow. During the BCD store lookup, PBR will locate the attacker's BCD store and mistakenly identify its target volume as the Recovery volume. Consequently, PBR will load its configuration from the Recovery volume, which instructs it to decrypt the BitLocker-encrypted OS volume. Once PBR completes its process, BitLocker secrets become freely accessible, as BitLocker was disabled by PBR.</p>\n<p>Figure 42: Exploitation flow</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LU9RckphUw?image-dimensions=940x458&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>Figure 43: Demo – cmd.exe with OS volume fully-decrypted</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/bS00NDQyODA2LTF1YVNVdA?image-dimensions=940x501&amp;revision=8\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>This vulnerability and the entire exploitation chain was patched in 2025’s July Patch Tuesday and received the ID of <strong>CVE-2025-48818.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"vulnerability-fixes\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#vulnerability-fixes\">#</a> <strong>Vulnerability Fixes</strong></h3>\n<p>All the discovered vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques were fixed in 2025’s July Patch Tuesday.

"<p>2014年，台湾的笔记本ODM厂商蓝天发布了一个全新的笔记本电脑系列：P770/50ZM。虽然它们与隔壁友商微星的GT72一样都是台系笔记本厂商在旗舰游戏本上抛弃Optimus走向独显直连的先驱，但P750/70ZM自身还有一个更重要的意义-它象征着桌面处理器方案第一次在商业量产笔记本上出现。不过，由于彼时的高性能笔记本电脑普遍使用基于Socket G3的可更换CPU设计，这点在当时并没能让它在一众机型中脱颖而出。<br />\n2015年末，英特尔迎来了传奇的Skylake处理器微架构。Skylake架构的传奇之处不仅在于它第一次在消费级硬件上带来DDR4内存，更在于它可谓是英特尔自从酷睿2以来最长寿的微架构。从2015年的Skylake到2020年的Comet  Lake，这款微架构见证了包括AMD再次崛起、MSDT突破四核桎梏以及Apple再次转向软硬一体化等消费电子领域的历史性事件。无须讳言，光是这段时间中消费电子领域的热点技术进步本身就能继续展开一篇文章，暂且不展开。总之，Skylake架构除了带来DDR4内存之外，在笔记本领域也带来了一项变动-全线BGA，Socket  G3正式后继无人（好吧其实正式来说Broadwell就已经没有PGA的CPU了，但毕竟。）诚然，这一改动能够允许OEM设计并制造更为轻便的设备，但以消费者的维修权作为代价也确实值得商榷。无论如何，蓝天也同样设计制造了P770/50ZM的迭代机型，也就是本文的主角，蓝天P775/50系列。由于P775/50本质上为同款机型，本文中所有数据均基于P775DM2机型测试。</p>\n<h1

作为蓝天的桌面单卡旗舰（同期亦有双卡机型P870），P775DM2可谓是蓝天工业设计之集大成者。继承自770ZM的设计语言，整机切削的形状、尾部从汽车继承的格栅设计，以及A面的线条无一不彰显着它作为旗舰板砖游戏本的骄傲与自豪。同期的微盟16L1（另一款支持LGA  1151接口的准系统游戏本）设计十分类似，只是还有一个抠掉龙盾和RGB、换上Xeon与Quadro的“工作站”版本令人有点迷惑：这种设计放在游戏本上彰显个性很好，但作为工作站是否有点过于张扬？话说回来，由于是准系统，它的A面没有任何品牌Logo（比如那个土鳖到爆炸的战神），当然如果有贴个几十块的贴膜就行。</p>\n<h2 id=\"主板\"><a class=\"anchor\"

1151插槽和显卡用的MXM插槽之外与一块普通的游戏本主板也没多少区别。</p>\n<h2 id=\"uefi-firmware\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#uefi-firmware\">#</a> UEFI Firmware</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"

1151处理器。通过刷入<a href=\"http://www.smxdiy.com/space-uid-1196.html\">SMXDIY论坛dsanke大佬</a>提供的<a href=\"http://www.smxdiy.com/thread-3652-1-1.html\">魔改版BIOS</a>，用户可以在这台机器上安装酷睿6-9代全系列处理器，以及i9-10980HK（的ES转针U）或CC150等特殊处理器（除Skylake ES），显卡也可以支持到目前最新的3080 MXM。<br />\n需要声明的是，如果需要刷写BIOS，需要拆机，并利用CH341a等刷写器对BIOS芯片进行操作。这一操作是有一定危险性的，请万分谨慎，并确认自己有足够的技术能力处理这些问题再下手。</p>\n<h2 id=\"cpu\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#cpu\">#</a> CPU</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/CPU-z.png\" alt=\"CPU-Z\" /> 既然采用了Z170芯片组，CPU自然是基于LGA  1151接口的产品。所有的1151CPU都是Skylake的产品，而Skylake作为Intel的常青树架构在2022年的眼光来看性能也仍然够用。而这台具体的机器搭载的是一颗65W的Coffee Lake ES处理器，型号是QN8H。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/CPU.jpg\" alt=\"CPU\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/CPU_back.jpg\" alt=\"CPU\" /> 物理六核，2.9G，65W，规模上就是8700的ES，就是一颗很普通的处理器，购买时售价一千出头，把原配的7700用两千块回收之后还能剩下一点钱买个Nexus 6P，这波啊，这波是减钱提性能。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\"

1151接口本身倒是没啥可说的。从H110到Z390，这个插槽某种意义上算是Tick-Tock迭代策略甚至整个Intel处理器业务的ICU，连续四代CPU无论是微架构还是制程节点都没有显著改进，全靠核显、频率、核心规模拓展和对微架构的打磨获取综合体验的提升，甚至这个核心规模的提升还是在友商将八核杀到MSDT的前提下被迫进行的回应，不得不让人开始怀疑Intel是否已经失去当年引领业界的技术实力。HEDT友商16-32-64打核战争常年18核卖$999，服务器up to 28c socket/56c  BGA属实摆烂中的战斗机。尽管有各种各样技术上的原因去justify，这种摆烂依然是值得唾弃的。当然，自从Alder  Lake这枚半导体核弹爆炸，Intel也算是基本痊愈出院，不过，这就不是这篇文章的主题了。</p>\n<h2 id=\"内存\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#内存\">#</a> 内存</h2>\n<p>作为旗舰板砖本，P775DM2支持四个内存插槽，以双通道2DPC的模式部署。同样，由于直到Z370和Coffee Lake平台才有128GB内存的官方支持，默认情况下的P775DM2只支持64GB内存，但在刷完BIOS之后，也可以支持128GB的内存。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/ram_1.jpg\" alt=\"DIMM0_1\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/ram_2.jpg\" alt=\"DIMM2_3\" /> 四个内存插槽分为两组，DIMM0和1在键盘下方，DIMM2和3在主板背面。同样，0和1或2和3都是一个单独的通道，只有0、2或1、3才是双通道。当然，对于土豪来说，把四个插槽全部插上32G的内存条，组成128G内存池就可以直接毕业了。另外一点需要注意的是，这台机器最高只支持2666的内存速度，这点对一些内存敏感的游戏或应用来说可能造成困扰。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/ram_used.jpg\" alt=\"Used RAM\" /> 在本次测试中使用的内存是两条三星M471A2K43EB1-CWE，双面dual rank 4BG，组成32GB双通道。标称频率3200 CL22，实际频率2666

2022这样只提供一个M.2硬盘槽的产品。这台P775DM2在存储上也继承了内存的宽裕，提供两个同时支持NVMe和SATA的M.2接口和两个2.5英寸SATA硬盘位。其中，两个SATA盘位和一个M.2接口被独立在一个硬盘仓中，另外一个M.2接口则在主板仓中。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/bus.png\" alt=\"Bus layout\" /> 不过，由于Z170芯片组本身的限制，所有存储器都连接到PCH上，没有直连CPU的存储。为了减少测试时存储系统的瓶颈，所有测试用的应用程序都在一张SN550固态硬盘上运行。虽然不是什么顶尖好盘，但是消除存储瓶颈绝对是足够的。</p>\n<h3 id=\"sata硬盘座\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#sata硬盘座\">#</a> SATA硬盘座</h3>\n<p>既然有SATA硬盘的空间，就必须要有用于稳定SATA硬盘的结构。固态硬盘只需要担心是否会搞坏接口，但机械盘还存在硬盘本身在震动中损坏的风险。不过，P775DM2上的SATA硬盘座还是比较简单甚至简陋的。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/sata_plate.jpg\" alt=\"SATA plate\" /> 一片铁板、三个螺丝，就这样。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/sata_plate_1.jpg\" alt=\"SATA

src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/sata_plate_3.jpg\" alt=\"SATA plate installed\" /> 需要注意的是，在P775DM2上装2.5英寸硬盘需要把SATA口往上，也就是说要把铭文面朝下。在装上硬盘之后，还需要利用一颗螺丝固定，避免使用时的震动。</p>\n<h3 id=\"sata子板\"><a

href=\"#gpu\">#</a> GPU</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/GPU.png\" alt=\"GPU\" /> 在P7xx/8xx系列机型上，GPU子板采用了MXM规格的异形板。MXM规格对大多数电脑玩家来说都颇为陌生，但对工作站和准系统玩家来说则再熟悉不过。它的全称是Mobile PCI-E  Module，虽然为什么移动式PCIe模组会缩写成MXM是个颇有意思的英语问题，但总而言之，MXM在本质上就是一个PCIe接口，能够为显卡提供最多16条PCIe 3.0通道。在P775DM2上，这张GTX 1070同样也是运作在满血的PCIe 3.0*16上。<br />\n纵观Pascal显卡的一生，除了与前辈Maxwell对比跨定位隔代强杀的性能提升，采用了先进的TSMC 16nm  FinFET制程使得它在能耗比方面得到显著的提升，而这也允许NVIDIA在笔记本平台使用与桌面平台同样规模的GPU，对游戏笔记本、嵌入式等使用场景来说，性能提升十分可观。当然，站在2022年的今天来看，这种同定位同规模仅仅持续了两代，在Ampere（以及友商的RDNA2）上，移动GPU一般都采用规模更接近低一定位桌面GPU的规模，例如RX 6800M在规模上无限接近桌面上的RX 6700XT，这不得不说是一种遗憾。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/GPU.jpg\" alt=\"GPU Core\" /><br />\n在笔记本电脑上的GTX  1070显卡使用的是跟桌面端1070一样的GP104核心，但具体型号是N17E-G2-A1。这颗芯片与桌面上的GP104-200-A1的区别主要在于规模：同样的8GB  GDDR5显存，同样的256位位宽，但相比桌面上区区15组流处理器、120组纹理单元和1920颗的CUDA核心，笔记本上的1070规模提升到整整16组流处理器、128组纹理单元，2048颗CUDA核心。规模的提升也带来了纹理填充率、单双精度浮点理论性能的提升。这应该是有史以来唯一一颗规模高过同定位桌面卡的移动GPU了但是，由于笔记本毕竟是个笔记本，在笔记本上，1070的标称TDP从150W降低到120W，频率也从1506MHz-1683MHz降低到1442MHz-1645MHz，它的理论像素填充率也有一定的下降。  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/GPU_vram.jpg\" alt=\"VRAM\" />  在GPU核心周围的一圈主要是供电电路以及显存，具体型号是K4G80325FB-HC22。这种显存使用FCBGA170接口，单颗容量8Gb，由32个256Mb的区块组成，速度高达9Gbps。在这张1070上，一共有8颗这样的显存，而在共板的GTX 1060 蓝天版上，虽然同样拥有八个焊盘，但只会焊接六颗显存。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/GPU_power.jpg\" alt=\"GPU Power cable\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/mxm_below.jpg\" alt=\"GPU Power port\" /> 不过，蓝天在旗舰机型上使用的MXM显卡与其他厂商甚至自家的其他产品线并不通用。在显卡的右上角可以明显看到一个8pin的供电线缆插槽，在不接上这根线的情况下，电脑是无法工作的。这根线需要接到主板上，旁边有两颗ITE IT8587E电源IC芯片。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/GPU_sli.jpg\" alt=\"SLI\" /> 与此同时，除了由于规模和功耗差别带来的理论性能差距之外，包括SLI在内的各色Pascal特色功能在笔记本卡上都有得到保留，因此在这张显卡的MXM接口上方左侧还有一个接口，这是专门为在P870这样的双卡机型上启用SLI模式而保留的，只需要用专用的SLI线将两张显卡上的SLI接口连接起来就可以在驱动程序中启动。不过，由于在Pascal年代能够提供稳定SLI增益的游戏已经少之又少，多显卡能够带来增益的场景几乎只有重度GPGPU计算，在实际使用中会去使用这一接口的消费者也确实少之又少。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/GPU_output.jpg\" alt=\"GPU Output\" /> 除了性能，另外一点是多屏能力。由于笔记本电脑结构上的限制，除了少部分面向专业用户的机型外，很少有笔记本电脑支持3+1式的图形输出（即三个外接显示器+一个内部显示器），而P775DM2就是其中之一。两个miniDP 1.4与一个HDMI 2.0，加上内部的eDP，应该说足够大多数人用了。<br />\n不过需要注意的是，由于四条输出通道都被占用，如果需要使用雷电/USB-C显示器一线通功能，就需要在BIOS中进行一些设置，否则将无法使用DP Alt输出功能。当然，设置完成之后，对应的DP口也会失去视频信号。</p>\n<h2 id=\"散热系统\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#散热系统\">#</a> 散热系统</h2>\n<p>众所周知，高性能必然带来高发热，而对于笔记本这种空间受限的产品来说，能否及时将各类芯片和电子元器件产生的热量排除机外是确保它能否长期稳定工作的关键条件。即使对于体积相对硕大无朋的P775DM2来说，这一基本原理也仍然适用，甚至由于它搭载的硬件是正儿八经的台式机级硬件，对于散热系统的压力只会更大。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/heatpipe.jpg\" alt=\"Heatpipe\" /> 当然，P775DM2的散热器还是尽职地完成了任务。尽管还是传统的热管+风扇结构，但P775DM2的散热器如同米格25一样诠释着力大砖飞的真谛：不需要花里胡哨的均热板和液态金属，只靠足够硕大的体积和重量来压制发热，这实在是只有在板砖中才能见识到的暴力美学。总共五条1cm粗的热管，一根贯穿机身由CPU和GPU共享，CPU独享一根GPU独享两根，还有一根同时照顾CPU和GPU上电气元件的发热。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/fans.jpg\" alt=\"Fans\" /> 当然，能够导热还不够，热量需要及时地被排出机身。P775DM2也是如此。不过，颇为少见的是，P775DM2上的两个风扇是完全一致的，而不像一些其他机型一样无法互换，这能够有效节约供应链和库存成本，对于用户来说后期维修更换也更为方便。扯远了，这两颗风扇是台湾协禧电机制造的，12V0.5A，在拉满之后噪音确实颇大，但是只要不手动拉满就很难有明显的噪音。</p>\n<h2 id=\"io\"><a

src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/right.jpg\" alt=\"Right IO\" /> 与狂暴的配置相比，P775DM2的IO堪称保守。四个USB3 5Gbps，一个USB-C 10Gbps，一个雷电3，RJ45、四个音频接口、SD卡槽以及视频输出接口。尽管作为笔记本来说这个IO已经能称得上宽裕，但毕竟还是与台式机相差好几个重量级。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/io_board.jpg\" alt=\"IO Board\" /> <img

src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/io_board_installed.jpg\" alt=\"IO board installed\" /> 不过，在这篇评测中特地提到IO的原因主要还是这块子板。这块子板装在右侧，负责两个USB3和四个音频接口。两颗ASM1464信号中继器用于中继USB信号并加强供电。这种设计在游戏本上是极为少见的，不仅因为这种子板设计本身就已经很罕见，更是因为现在已经有厂商能够通过软排线拉出Thunderbolt，对信号带宽、完整性和延迟要求更低的USB来说设计子板与排线的难度还要更低，现在已经不需要利用额外的硬件中继器了。</p>\n<h3 id=\"音频\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#音频\">#</a> 音频</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/bass_front.jpg\" alt=\"Speaker Front\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\"

<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/stereo_back.jpg\" alt=\"Stereo Back\" /> P775DM2的音频子系统很有趣，外放是一个重低音炮+C面立体声音响，基本等于只能听个响，但声卡的规模远非大部分电脑上的RealTek AC97可比。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/dac.jpg\" alt=\"DAC\" /> 它采用了一颗ESS  ES9018K2M低功耗32位立体声DAC，同时使用了一颗NEC制造的UD2-5NU继电器，提供了四个3.5mm音频接口。好吧，也许与各种动辄四五位数的专业声学设备无法相比，但与AC97声卡相比还是更高端的选择。这些元器件与对应的电路同样在子板上，进一步加剧了信号复杂度。</p>\n<h3 id=\"雷电3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#雷电3\">#</a> 雷电3</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/thunderbolt.jpg\" alt=\"Thunderbolt controller\" /> 尽管随着11代酷睿将雷电主控集成进CPU本体，雷电接口的普及程度得到了极大的提高，现在你甚至可以在4-5千元价位的笔记本电脑上看到雷电接口的存在，但在P775DM2的时代，雷电接口仍然是只有顶级的笔记本电脑才会搭载的存在。不仅是因为厂商需要在设计时额外为一个控制芯片留好空间、走线与预算，还因为彼时这个Intel与Apple合作的接口仍然需要支付一笔不菲的专利费，这一费用最终仍然需要被转嫁到消费者头上，自然就无法普及开来。<br />\n不过，对于P775DM2来说，这点小事并不构成问题。P775DM2使用的雷电控制器是DSL6540，作为最早的雷电3控制器Alpine Ridge家族的成员，它连接到网卡右侧第一个USB-C接口，提供基于PCIe总线的高速数据传输。</p>\n<h3 id=\"网络\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#网络\">#</a> 网络</h3>\n<p>作为一台现代的旗舰游戏本，P775DM2的网络功能还是该有的都有了。尽管因为时代限制没有Gb+的有线网和原厂WiFi6支持，但这套配置在2017年绝对是旗舰中的旗舰。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/wifi.jpg\" alt=\"Wireless Card\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/ethernet.jpg\" alt=\"Ethernet\" /> 有线网络方案是杀手的Killer  E2400，而原装的无线网卡则是杀手1535。杀手这个名字听起来霸气，而且特别“游戏范”，但这一厂牌的本质是将市场上已有的网络设备进行重贴牌并捆绑自己的驱动贩售，与其说性能如何不如说纯纯是为了卖点存在。这台电脑上的两张网卡分别贴牌的是膏通Atheros的千兆网卡和Intel的AC1535。说性能差绝对有失公允，但是绝对没有什么特别的。<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/WWAN_solder_point.jpg\" alt=\"WWAN Solder point\" /> 不过有一点颇有意思的是，在主板上还有一个标注着3G/LTE的焊盘。也许这款机型曾经设计过支持WWAN网络，抑或是某款主板提供对应支持呢。不过，很难想象有多少用户会在这种尺寸的机型上使用WWAN。</p>\n<h2 id=\"键盘\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#键盘\">#</a> 键盘</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"

由于尺寸上相对并没有多少限制，整个P7xx系列的键盘无论是键位还是手感都很棒。真要说哪里有问题，就是右侧的Shift键被砍半，以为全尺寸方向键提供空间，不过总体而言的打字体验还是足够舒适的。</p>\n<h2 id=\"屏幕\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#屏幕\">#</a> 屏幕</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/panel.jpg\" alt=\"Panel\" /> 由于是准系统，屏幕这块自然也有说头。AUO的B173QTN01.0在现在看来实在没有什么值得说道的，尽管拥有QHD分辨率、72%NTSC的色域容积、120Hz刷新率同时支持硬件G-Sync，但是TN屏本身在显色原理上的先天劣势导致了这块屏幕泛白的现象十分严重。尤其是现在高刷高分高素质的QHD 165Hz甚至UHD 120Hz面板都随处可见，这块面板自身也有老化现象，更是拉开了差距。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/edp.jpg\" alt=\"eDP Connector\" /> 不过好在，如果需要更换的话，板载的四通道eDP接口有足够的带宽应付4K120Hz屏幕所需的数据流，所以这也就是一个砸钱可解的问题罢了。</p>\n<h2 id=\"电池与适配器\"><a

src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/battery_back.jpg\" alt=\"Battery info\" /> 对于这种硬件规模的游戏本来说，与其叫做游戏本，不如叫做带键盘触摸板显示器UPS的NUC更为合适。尽管P775DM2的电池高达82Wh,它的续航时间仍然屈指可数。这颗电池的型号是P750BAT-8  6-87-P750S-4272，由台湾新普科技制造。这种电池在整个P7xx系列的机器中都可以通用。需要注意的是，与大多数笔记本电脑将电池作为机器一部分塞在D壳后面不同，P775DM2的电池是可拆卸的，同时它自身就是D壳的一部分，承担支撑作用。 <img loading=\"lazy\"

至于适配器，台达代工的ADP-330AB D型适配器，支持100-240V宽电压，输出19.5V 16.9A  330W功率，光是适配器本体就比一些电脑整机还要更重。在适配器上还有一个LED灯，只要接上电就能够亮起，提示操作者电源工作正常，这点在近年的很多适配器上已经没有了，不得不令人惋惜。 <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://pegionfish.github.io/img/p775dm2/adapter_port.jpg\" alt=\"Port\" /> 在连接电脑的一端，它使用的是一个DIN-4四针接头。两根相距较远的线走正极，两根相聚较近的线走正极，在主板上转换成其他元器件需要的规格。这种接头的电源在高性能笔记本、一体机等场合曾经比较常见，但由于尺寸上的限制，现在已经甚少有产品使用。</p>\n<h1 id=\"理论性能测试\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#理论性能测试\">#</a>

在测试中，CPU是一条平整的65W直线，GPU也是一条平整的100W直线。至于为什么是100W而不是120W，这是蓝天1070  OC显卡的VBIOS通病，实际功耗墙触发点是标准值（125W）的80%，需要通过修改VBIOS解决。本评测并不涉及对P775DM2进行魔改（因为要魔改可以改很多东西），因此对此也不做任何修正，as is without warranty。</p>\n<h2

作为DX11游戏的代表，地铁：最后的曙光重制版的压力同样不小。在1080P全高画质下运行三轮基于游戏最终章斯巴达人抵抗第四帝国入侵场景的测试，可以看到平均帧数只有70帧左右，最低甚至掉下过14帧，翻译成人话就是能玩，但偶尔会有点小卡顿。</p>\n<h2 id=\"csgo\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#csgo\">#</a> CSGO</h2>\n<p><img

总结</h1>\n<p>以2022年的视角来看，重板砖笔记本电脑业已成为时代的眼泪。随着核心数战争与频率战争的展开，三家上游核心供应商陷入了永无止尽的追求更高更快更强的竞赛。消费者很难评价它的对错与否，毕竟这场竞赛的结果确实能够翻译成消费者有明显感知的更高的帧数、更快的编译，甚至价格还可能更便宜。但是，作为代价，它们也正在变得越来越大、越来越耗电、越来越热。在这台电脑所在的Pascal时代，即使是搭载GP102核心的消费级卡皇Titan Xp，推荐电源也仅仅是600W。而现在，这个规格的电源在NVIDIA的眼里只配运行搭载GA104的中端甜品RTX  3060。也许对于台式机来说，能买得起这些高规格硬件的消费者也有足够的金钱和空间来安装大功率电源和大尺寸水冷，但在寸土寸金、体积与供电都受到严重限制的笔记本电脑上，这样的进步意义究竟几何仍需要探讨。<br />\n出于这些原因，以P775DM2为代表的这些板砖逐渐成为了时代的眼泪，慢慢的淡出了人们的视线。当然，板砖必然还是存在的。抛开那些面向企事业单位和机构的、动辄六位数人民币的移动工作站不谈，即使是面向消费者的游戏本，也有微星GT77  Titan这样的暴力怪物，整机250W的功耗表现足以让它在游戏本的世界里屠戮全场，但P775DM2这样的传奇永远不会回来了。它的续作-X170的二代机采用了全Intel的方案，BGA CPU+BGA显卡，已经与一台普通的游戏本并无而致。也许，直到这个时候，我们才可以放心的吹熄为它点亮的最后一支蜡烛，正式宣布一句She’s  gone.<br />\n那么，我到底是在怀念什么？仅仅是在怀念过去的good old  days吗？还是一个守旧的老古董的无病呻吟？我想都不是。P775DM2代表的并不仅仅是一个desktop  replacement大行其道的年代，更是发烧友精神本身。CPU、显卡、内存、硬盘，固件tweak，黑苹果，MXM-PCIe转接卡，全机水冷，you name  it.这样的自由度不仅能够让用户以自己的预算灵活搭配配置，还可以通过升级的方式延长使用寿命，甚至可以进行一些电气改装。说实话，玩了这么多年电脑，我还真没听说过有多少厂商愿意提供自己的主板pin  layout等技术文档。它的问题严重到令人无法忽视：尽管理论可以升级但MXM异型卡的价格几乎是同定位桌面卡的两倍，对大多数人来说升级完全不存在性价比、在软件上下的功夫完全没法与（实际上）定价类似的一线厂商相提并论，保修层面更是被打得毫无招架之力-准系统玩家只能通过购买渠道获得十分漫长的保修，我有一次修卡就花了一个月，这还是在社区内颇有信誉的店家购买的机器。而在此基础上，它笨重、续航为零、噪音大的“优势”也让携带它去图书馆之类的场合成为一件几乎不可能的事情，虽然以它十分张扬的外观来说大部分人也应该不愿意背着它去严肃场景吧。以P775DM2为代表的准系统笔记本只适合一类人-电脑发烧友，而且是愿意为了电脑本身牺牲一切的发烧友。这个发烧友需要有勇气去面对软硬件上的各种不好用，并且有足够的能力去自行-或者参考别人的攻略-改善它。同时，ta还需要有足够的预算去购买各种折腾用的器材。CH341a、硅脂、导热垫都只是入门，之后的投入更是不可估量。这样的人不仅相对电脑用户少得可怜，他们还需要经常问自己这个问题：我为什么不去折腾标准硬件（例如ITX）。但说实在的，这个问题，我也不知道该怎么回答。也许，那个时代，真的再也不会回来了吧。</p>\n",

href=\"#111-类人行为图灵测试方法\">#</a> <strong>1.1.1 类人行为:图灵测试方法</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>图灵测试</strong>(<strong>Turing test</strong>)是由艾伦·图灵(Alan Turing)提出的(Turing, 1950),它被设计成一个思维实验,用以回避“机器能思考吗?”这个哲学上模糊的问题。如果人类提问者在提出一些书面问题后无法分辨书面回答是来自人还是来自计算机,那么计算机就能通过测试。</p>\n<p>目前,为计算机编程使其能够通过严格的应用测试尚有大量工作要做。计算机需要具备下列能力:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>自然语言处理</strong>(<strong>natural language processing</strong>) ,以使用人类语言成功地交流;</li>\n<li><strong>知识表示</strong>(<strong>knowledge representation</strong>) ,以存储它所知道或听到的内容;</li>\n<li><strong>自动推理</strong>(<strong>automated

,以适应新的环境,并检测和推断模式。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>图灵认为,没有必要对人进行物理模拟来证明智能。然而,其他研究人员提出了<strong>完全图灵测试</strong>(<strong>total Turing test</strong>) ,该测试需要与真实世界中的对象和人进行交互。为了通过完全图灵测试,机器人还需要具备下列能力:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>计算机视觉</strong>(<strong>computer vision</strong>)和语音识别功能,以感知世界;</li>\n<li><strong>机器人学</strong>(<strong>robotics</strong>)

种方式了解人类的思维:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>内省</strong>(<strong>introspection</strong>)——试图在自己进行思维活动时捕获思维;</li>\n<li><strong>心理实验</strong>(<strong>psychological experiment</strong>)——观察一个人的行为;</li>\n<li><strong>大脑成像</strong>(<strong>brain imaging</strong>)——观察大脑的活动。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>一旦我们有了足够精确的心智理论,就有可能把这个理论表达为计算机程序。如果程序的输入/

science</strong>)这一跨学科领域汇集了人工智能的计算机模型和心理学的实验技术,用以构建精确且可测试的人类心智理论。</p>\n<p>真正的认知科学必须建立在对人类或动物实验研究的基础上。这里,我们假设读者只有一台可以做实验的计算机,因此我们将把这方面的内容留给其他书籍。</p>\n<h3 id=\"113-理性思考思维法则方法\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#113-理性思考思维法则方法\">#</a> <strong>1.1.3 理性思考:“思维法则”方法</strong></h3>\n<p>希腊哲学家亚里士多德是最早试图法则化“正确思维”的人之一,他将其定义为无可辩驳的推理过程。他的<strong>三段论</strong>(<strong>syllogism</strong>)为论证结构提供了模式,当给出正确的前提时,总能得出正确的结论。这些思维法则被认为支配着思想的运作,他们的研究开创了一个称为<strong>逻辑</strong>(<strong>logic</strong>)的领域。</p>\n<p>任何用逻辑符号描述的可解问题在原则上都可以用程序求解。人工智能中所谓的<strong>逻辑主义</strong>(<strong>logicism</strong>)传统希望在此类程序的基础上创建智能系统。</p>\n<p>按照常规的理解,逻辑要求关于世界的认知是确定的,而实际上这很难实现。<strong>概率</strong>(<strong>probability</strong>)论填补了这一鸿沟,允许我们在掌握不确定信息的情况下进行严格的推理。原则上,它允许我们构建全面的理性思维模型,从原始的感知到对世界运作方式的理解,再到对未来的预测。它无法做到的是形成智能行为。为此,我们还需要关于理性行为的理论,仅靠理性思考是不够的。</p>\n<h3 id=\"114-理性行为理性智能体方法\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#114-理性行为理性智能体方法\">#</a> <strong>1.1.4 理性行为:理性智能体方法</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>智能体</strong>(<strong>agent</strong>)就是某种能够采取行动的东西(agent 来自拉丁语 agere,意为“做”)。<strong>理性智能体</strong>(<strong>rational agent</strong>)需要为取得最佳结果或在存在不确定性时取得最佳期望结果而采取行动。</p>\n<p>基于人工智能的“思维法则”方法重视正确的推断。做出正确推断有时是作为理性智能体的一部分,因为采取理性行为的一种方式是推断出某个给定的行为是最优的,然后根据这个结论采取行动。但是,理性行为的有些方式并不能说涉及推断。</p>\n<p>通过图灵测试所需的所有技能也使智能体得以采取理性行为。知识表示和推理能让智能体做出较好的决策。我们需要具备生成易于理解的自然语言句子的能力,以便在复杂的社会中生存。我们需要学习不仅是为了博学多才,也是为了提升我们产生高效行为的能力,尤其是在新环境下,这种能力更加重要。</p>\n<p>与其他方法相比,基于人工智能的理性智能体方法有两个优点。首先,它比“思维法则”方法更普适,因为正确的推断只是实现理性的几种可能机制之一。其次,它更适合科学发展。理性的标准在数学上是明确定义且完全普适的。我们经常可以从这个标准规范中得出可以被证明能够实现的智能体设计,而把模仿人类行为或思维过程作为目标的设计在很大程度上是不可能的。</p>\n<p>简而言之,<strong><mark>人工智能专注于研究和构建做正确的事情的智能体</mark></strong>,其中正确的事情<br />\n是我们提供给智能体的目标定义。这种通用范式非常普遍,以至于我们可以称之为<strong>标准模型</strong>(<strong>standard model</strong>) 。它不仅适用于人工智能,也适用于其他领域。控制理论中,控制器使代价函数最小化;运筹学中,策略使奖励的总和最大化;统计学中,决策规则使损失函数最小;经济学中,决策者追求效用或某种意义的社会福利最大化。</p>\n<p>然而在复杂的环境中,完美理性(总是采取精确的最优动作)是不可行的,它的计算代价太高了,因此需要对标准模型做一些重要的改进。<strong>有限理性</strong>(<strong>limited</strong><br />\n<strong>rationality</strong>),也就是在没有足够时间进行所有可能的计算的情况下,适当地采取行动。但是,完美理性仍然是理论分析的良好出发点。</p>\n<h3 id=\"115-益机\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#115-益机\">#</a> <strong>1.1.5 益机</strong></h3>\n<p>在我们的真实需求和施加给机器的目标之间达成一致的问题称为<strong>价值对齐问题</strong>(<strong>value alignment problem</strong>) ,即施加给机器的价值或目标必须与人类的一致。</p>\n<p>一台实现固定目标的机器可能会出现很多不当行为,要预测所有不当行为是不可能的。因此,我们有足够理由认为标准模型是不充分的。我们不希望机器“聪明”地实现它们的目标,而是希望它们实现我们的目标。</p>\n<p>如果我们不能将这些目标完美地传达给机器,就需要一个新的表述,也就是机器正在实现我们的目标,但对于目标是什么则是不确定的。当一台机器意识到它不了解完整的目标时,它就会有谨慎行动的动机,会寻求许可,并通过观察来更多地了解我们的偏好,遵守人为控制。最终,我们想要的是对人类<strong>可证益</strong>(<strong>provably beneficial</strong>)智能体。</p>\n<h2 id=\"12-人工智能的基础\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#12-人工智能的基础\">#</a> <strong>1.2 人工智能的基础</strong></h2>\n<p>在本节中,我们将简要介绍为人工智能提供思想、观点和技术的学科的历史。像任何历史一样,本书只关注少数人物、事件和思想,而忽略其他同样重要的。</p>\n<h3 id=\"121-哲学\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#121-哲学\">#</a> <strong>1.2.1 哲学</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>可以使用形式化规则得出有效结论吗?</li>\n<li>思维是如何从物质大脑中产生的?</li>\n<li>知识从何而来?</li>\n<li>知识如何导致行为?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>亚里士多德(Aristotle,公元前 384—公元前 322)制定了一套精确的法则来统御思维的理性部分,他是历史上第一位这样做的哲学家。他发展了一套非正式的三段论系统进行适当的推理,该系统原则上允许人们在给定初始前提下机械地得出结论。</p>\n<p>拉蒙·鲁尔(Ramon Llull,约 1232—1315)设计了一种推理系统,发表为 Ars Magna(即The Great Art) (Llull , 1305)  。鲁尔试图使用实际的机械设备——一组可以旋转成不同排列的纸盘——实现他的系统。</p>\n<p>大约在 1500 年,达·芬奇(Leonardo da Vinci,1452—1519)设计了一台机械计算器,虽然当时并未制造,但最近的重构表明该设计是可行的。第一台已知的计算器是在 1623 年左右由德国科学家威廉·席卡德(Wilhelm Schickard,1592—1635)制造的。布莱斯·帕斯卡(Blaise Pascal,1623—1662)于 1642 年建造了滚轮式加法器(Pascaline),并写道:“它产生的效用似乎比动物的所有行为更接近思维。”戈特弗里德·威廉·莱布尼茨(Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,1646—1716)制造了一台机械设备,旨在根据概念而非数值进行操作,但其应用范围相当有限。托马斯·霍布斯(Thomas Hobbes,1588—1679)在《利维坦》 (Leviathan)一书中提出了会思考的机器的想法,用他的话说就是一种“人造动物”,设想“心脏无非就是发条,神经只是一些游丝,而关节不过是一些齿轮。”他还主张推理就像是数值计算,认为“推理就是一种计算,也就是相加减。”</p>\n<p>有观点认为,思维至少在某种程度上是根据逻辑或数值规则运作的,可以建立模仿其中的一些规则的物理系统。也有观点说,思维本身就是这样一个物理系统。</p>\n<p>勒内·笛卡儿(René Descartes,1596—1650)首次清晰地讨论了思维与物质之间的区别。他指出,思维的纯粹物理概念似乎没有给自由意志留下多少空间。如果思维完全受物理法则支配,那么它拥有的自由意志不会比一块“决定”往下掉的石头多。笛卡儿是<strong>二元论</strong>(<strong>dualism</strong>)的支持者。他认为,人思维(灵魂或者精神)的一部分处于自然之外,不受物理定律的约束。但是,动物不具备这种二元特性,它们可以被视为机器。</p>\n<p><strong>唯物主义</strong>(<strong>materialism</strong>)是二元论的一种替代,它认为大脑根据物理定律的运作构成了思维。自由意志仅仅是实体对可选决策的感知。物理主义(physicalism)和自然主义(naturalism)这两个术语也被用于描述这类与超自然观点相反的观点。</p>\n<p>如果给定可以操纵知识的实体思维,接下来的问题就是建立知识的来源。经验主义(empiricism)运动始于弗朗西斯·培根(Francis Bacon,1561—1626)的《新工具》<br />\n(Novum Organum)a 一书,并以约翰·洛克(John Locke,1632—1704)的名言“知识归根到底都来源于经验”为特征。</p>\n",

下由于精度问题，几乎一定会出现色带，因此抗色带处理是 8-bit  低码率压制中的关键。当然，低码率下纹理和线条也会被涂抹地比较厉害，但一般观众也不容易看出，可以忽略。</p>\n<p>之前的章节提过，抗色带的基本手段就是加噪，一个自然的想法是借助 dither 的力量。dither 的算法多种多样，预览效果不错，但编码器往往不吃这套。就算加了高质量 dither，也会被编码器抹掉，还会留下丑陋的噪点尸体。</p>\n<p>所以这种情况下，我们只有一种选择，<code>ordered dither</code>。ordered dither 虽然丑陋，但是占体积小，并且难以被编码器抹平。如果我们需要把一个 16bit 视频降到 8bit 输出给编码器，可以这样写：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes

href=\"https://bbs.acgrip.com/thread-3848-1-1.html\">FontLoaderSub</a> 和 <a href=\"https://bbs.acgrip.com/thread-1894-1-1.html\">ListAssFonts</a>。</p>\n<p>FontLoaderSub 可以分析字幕使用的字体，并临时挂载，避免在系统中安装过多的字体。需要将 FontLoaderSub 放到字体包目录下，第一次运行建立字体数据库，之后拖入字幕即可临时挂载字体。</p>\n<p>如下图，[ok] 是加载成功的字体，显示路径说明是临时加载的。</p>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-12/image02\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-12/image02</a> FontLoaderSub.png)</p>\n<p>点击 <code>菜单</code> 按钮，可以选择 <code>导出字体</code>，导出所有临时加载的字体到指定目录。注意不能导出系统已经安装的字体。</p>\n<p>ListAssFonts 也可以分析字幕使用的字体，但是分析更加精准。FontLoaderSub 会报出定义了样式但实际不使用的字体，而 ListAssFonts  只会给出实际使用的字体。另外，ListAssFonts  还会对字幕格式做一些检查，比如样式的语法、字体是否缺字等。但是注意，ListAssFonts 不能检测出 FontLoaderSub  临时挂载的字体，会认为它们缺失。</p>\n<p>如下图，黑色是系统已有的字体，红色是缺少的字体。</p>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-12/image03\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-12/image03</a> ListAssFonts.png)</p>\n<p>勾选 <code>Save Fonts</code>，并选择 <code>Select ASS/SSA Folder</code> 中指定目录，可以导出系统已经安装的字体。</p>\n<p>通过这俩配合，就能导出所有安装和未安装的字体，这在没有字体包时候会非常有用。</p>\n<p>当然，和字幕组合作时，对方都会给出字体包，可以用 FontLoaderSub 临时挂载，或者直接安装，但无论使用哪种都需要验证压制之前已经安装/挂载好所有需要的字体。</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-压制参数\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-压制参数\">#</a> 4. 压制参数</h2>\n<p>8-bit 低码率通常定位都是兼容移动端的，因此使用 x264 来编码。另一方面，x265-8bit 表现实在太差，没有使用价值，都用 hevc 了，还是 10-bit 吧。</p>\n<p>8-bit 低码率需要注意这样几个参数：</p>\n<p><code>--fgo 1或者2</code><br />\n当然，这里的 fgo 不是你想的那个 fgo，它其实是 film grain optimization，可以把码率暴力分配给噪点。<br />\n<code>--psy-trellis 0.2~0.3</code><br />\n就是 --psy-rd 的第二个参数，效果与 fgo 类似。</p>\n<p><code>--psy-rd 0</code><br />\n这时候别用 psy-rd 了，这东西是会“保留复杂度”而不是“保留噪点”，它会把噪点搅拌压碎，很难看。<br />\n<code>--qcomp 0.7</code><br />\n这个不给高的话，动态和一些静止场面会比较难看，也可以关闭 mbtree 来代替。</p>\n<p>给一个参考编码参数：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes

1, --psy-rd 0:0, --no-mbtree</code>。当然这里还有一些可以改进的地方，在低码率下，可以适当开启 <code>deblock</code>，开到 <code>0:-1</code> 或者 <code>0:0</code> 都可以。<code>--keyint 600</code> 其实稍微有点大，最大约为 25s 一个关键帧，对于静态镜头较多的番拖进度会比较困难，可以减少到 360 甚至 240 比较合适。<code>--crf 18</code> 可以根据番剧实际情况，调整到 18~21 左右都行。</p>\n",

href=\"#3-音轨重排序\">#</a> (3). 音轨重排序</h3>\n<p>默认情况下，成品音轨的封装顺序与原盘中的顺序相同，但少数情况下这种顺序并不是我们希望的。</p>\n<p>OKE 提供了一种重新排序的方式，对于每条音轨，可以设置 <code>Order</code>。Order 是一个非负整数，OKE 会按照 Order 对音轨进行稳定的升序排序，即更小 Order 的轨道会在前面。</p>\n<p>默认情况下，所有音轨有最大的 Order，因此如果希望将某一音轨提到最前面，只需要设置 <code>Order = 1</code> 即可。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-有损音轨压制\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-有损音轨压制\">#</a> (4). 有损音轨压制</h3>\n<p>OKE 支持编码音轨为 AAC，但正常情况下只对无损音轨生效，有损音轨只能保持原状。根据整理规范，对于码率 &gt;= 512kbps 的有损音轨，需要二压为更低码率的 AAC。</p>\n<p>OKE 提供了有损音轨压制的方式，对于每条音轨，可以设置 <code>Lossy</code> 标签。如果为 true，则当源音轨为有损编码格式时也可重编码为 AAC。</p>\n<p>需要注意的是，并非所有有损格式都能二压，比如 eac3 格式，目前不支持二压。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-默认轨道标志\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-默认轨道标志\">#</a> (5). 默认轨道标志</h3>\n<p>OKE 会自动调整各音轨的默认轨道标志，只有正常封装的第一条音轨被标记为 <code>yes</code>，其他所有音轨，包括 mka 中的音轨都会被标记为 <code>no</code>。这样可以避免挂载 mka 时同时解码两条音轨，在部分播放环境下出错的问题。</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-字幕的处理\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-字幕的处理\">#</a> 3. 字幕的处理</h2>\n<p>与音轨类似，对于字幕轨，OKE 提供以下功能：空字幕轨的检测、可选字幕轨、字幕轨重排序、默认轨道标志的处理。</p>\n<p>前三个功能与音轨完全相同，字幕轨也同样支持 Optional 和 Order 标签功能，不再赘述。</p>\n<p>关于默认轨道标志，与音轨不同，原盘的字幕轨往往是日文或者英文，因此均默认标记为 <code>no</code>，这样播放时不会自动挂载字幕轨。</p>\n<p>除了原盘的 PGS

<code>00001.m2ts</code>，同目录下有同名章节 <code>00001.txt</code>，OKE 会自动提取章节并封入成品。</li>\n</ol>\n<p>当某些情况同时成立时，外挂章节的优先级更高。</p>\n<p>除了以上基础功能，OKE 还支持：指定章节语言、重命名章节标题、根据章节设置关键帧。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-指定章节语言\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-指定章节语言\">#</a> (1). 指定章节语言</h3>\n<p>默认情况下，OKE 总是设置章节语言为 eng。有时我们会手动填写章节日文标题，此时需要设置语言为 jpn。可以通过给外挂 txt 字幕添加语言后缀来实现，比如输入文件为 <code>00001.m2ts</code>，同目录下章节命名为 <code>00001.jpn.txt</code>，这样 OKE 就会读取语言标签，并在封装时设置为 jpn。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-重命名章节标题\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-重命名章节标题\">#</a> (2). 重命名章节标题</h3>\n<p>对于连体盘，经切割后，除了第一部分，后面部分的章节标题都不是从 <code>Chapter 01</code> 开始的。OKE 支持重命名章节标题，通过 <code>RenumberChapters</code> 来设置。在设置为 true 时，所给章节会从 <code>Chapter 01</code> 开始重新命名。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-根据章节设置关键帧\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-根据章节设置关键帧\">#</a> (3). 根据章节设置关键帧</h3>\n<p>OKE 会利用章节在各个章节点处设置关键帧。具体方式为，根据章节确定章节点的帧号，生成 qpfile 给编码器，指定章节点为关键帧。</p>\n<p>注意，这个功能会复写 qpfile 参数，因此自己在编码参数中设置的 qpfile 参数实际上无效。由于 qpfile 依赖于章节，需要特别注意章节的正确性，原则上必须在压制前修改章节，而不能在压制后修改。</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-vfr功能\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-vfr功能\">#</a> 5. VFR功能</h2>\n<p>OKE 支持动态帧率（VFR）视频的压制。在压制 VFR 时，不再需要指定帧率，但是需要设置 <code>TimeCode</code> 为 true 来开启 VFR 功能。</p>\n<p>开启 VFR 压制时，OKE 需要获取时间码文件 <code>.tcfile</code>，并在封装时写入时间码。与外挂章节文件类似，将时间码文件放到输入文件同目录并改名匹配。比如输入文件为 <code>00001.m2ts</code>，同目录下时间码文件命名为 <code>00001.tcfile</code>。</p>\n<p>事实上，由于 OKE 的压制流程中，在实际压制前会先运行 <code>vspipe -i</code> 来获取信息，我们可以在 vpy 脚本中实时生成 tcfile。</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#A0ADA0;--shiki-dark:#758575DD\">#OKE:INPUTFILE</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">a</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#B5695977;--shiki-dark:#C98A7D77\">\"</span><span style=\"color:#B56959;--shiki-dark:#C98A7D\">00000.m2ts</span><span style=\"color:#B5695977;--shiki-dark:#C98A7D77\">\"</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#A65E2B;--shiki-dark:#C99076\">...</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#A0ADA0;--shiki-dark:#758575DD\"># VFR splice</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#1E754F;--shiki-dark:#4D9375\">import</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\"> pathlib</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">path </span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\"> pathlib</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">.</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">Path</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">(</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">a</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">res </span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\"> mvf</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">.</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">VFRSplice</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">(</span><span style=\"color:#1e754f;--shiki-dark:#4d9375\">[</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">res_a</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\"> res_b</span><span style=\"color:#1e754f;--shiki-dark:#4d9375\">]</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#B07D48;--shiki-dark:#BD976A\"> tcfile</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#998418;--shiki-dark:#B8A965\">str</span><span style=\"color:#1e754f;--shiki-dark:#4d9375\">(</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">path</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">.</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">with_suffix</span><span style=\"color:#a65e2b;--shiki-dark:#d4976c\">(</span><span style=\"color:#B5695977;--shiki-dark:#C98A7D77\">'</span><span style=\"color:#B56959;--shiki-dark:#C98A7D\">.tcfile</span><span style=\"color:#B5695977;--shiki-dark:#C98A7D77\">'</span><span style=\"color:#a65e2b;--shiki-dark:#d4976c\">)</span><span style=\"color:#1e754f;--shiki-dark:#4d9375\">)</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">)</span></span></code></pre>\n",

RFF flag = repeat_first_field</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Source Frame</th>\n<th>0</th>\n<th>1</th>\n<th>2</th>\n<th>3</th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>TFF flag</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RFF flag</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Field</td>\n<td>0t</td>\n<td>0b</td>\n<td>1t</td>\n<td>1b</td>\n<td>1t_r</td>\n<td>2b</td>\n<td>2t</td>\n<td>3b</td>\n<td>3t</td>\n<td>3b_r</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Present Frame</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>相较于 hard telecine，此种方法是无损的，而且可以节省传输的流量。由于 pulldown flag 可以只添加在视频流的一部分帧，所以真实的视频流帧率可能是变化的（vfr）而非恒定的（cfr）。</p>\n<p><em>但是实际情况与标准不同，flag 错误、pulldown 错误都屡见不鲜，正确地分辨与处理就要仔细检查和积累经验。</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"4-隔行扫描视频的读取\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-隔行扫描视频的读取\">#</a> 4. 隔行扫描视频的读取</h2>\n<p>我们在处理隔行扫描视频之前，首先要先学会如何正确地读取。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-dgmpgdec\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-dgmpgdec\">#</a> (1). DGMPGDec</h3>\n<p>首先先看一套有点「老」的软件 DGMPGDec，这是 Donald A. Graft 基于 DVD2AVI 开发的自由软件。可以从 <a href=\"https://www.rationalqm.us/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html\">https://www.rationalqm.us/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html</a> 获取源代码和相应配套组件。仅适用于 MPEG-1 和 MPEG-2，主要是后者，常见的大多是 DVD 和 Transport Stream。</p>\n<p><em>以下基于 v2.0.0.8</em></p>\n<p>包内对 vs 有用的只有 DGIndex 和 DGDecode，这里也只介绍我们可能会用到的 DGIndex 功能。</p>\n<h4 id=\"dgindex\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#dgindex\">#</a> DGIndex</h4>\n<p>DGIndex 有一个 gui，基本操作是 <code>File - Open (F2)</code>，然后把需要加载的单个或多个文件 <code>ADD</code> 或拖拽上去，默认设置下 <code>File - Save Project (F4)</code> 会弹出 Information 窗口，显示结束后即可在源目录得到一个 <code>.d2v</code> 文件和 demux 的 <code>xxx DELAY xxxms.aac</code>。</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.d2v</code> 中记录的源文件名是绝对路径</li>\n<li>音频文件名上标注了需要 delay 的时间，mux 时可能会用到</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/dg_00-e840bc3a822bc05070f64c0150eea00c.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/dg_01-638a88fc6d0f4e0cab53dee08573651f.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>之所以会 demux 音轨是因为 <code>Audio -

Field Operation</code>，它只对含有 pulldown flags 的视频有意义。</p>\n<p>在介绍这个选项之前，需要先说明几个 DGMPGDec 中的概念：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Film：相当于 24p，通常表现为 24t</li>\n<li>NTSC Video：可略称为 Video，相当于 30p，通常表现为 30i、30p</li>\n<li>Hybrid：film 与 video 的混合，可能是时间上的也可能是空间上的</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/dg_03-900bb006ccac9cf0607dbf158000c991.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>回到 <code>Field Operation</code>：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Honor Pulldown Flags (Default)：模拟播放设备对标有 RFF 的场进行 repeat，返回 30fps clip。</li>\n<li>Ignore Pulldown Flags：忽略 RFF，返回原始 clip（会记录在 d2v 文件中但不会处理），24fps 的视频被标注为 30fps 的帧率。</li>\n<li>Force Film：将 24d 转换为 24p 并返回。</li>\n</ol>\n<p>设置 Field Operation 的工作流程一般是这样的，先使用 <code>Honor Pulldown Flags</code>，观察 Information 中的 <code>Video Type</code></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/dg_04-a3ef7774c8dd881c4d3afd101d541fb8.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>如果显示 NTSC 或 PAL 说明没有 pulldown flags，应继续使用之前生成的 d2v</li>\n<li>如果显示 Film 达到 95% 及以上（100% 也可被称为 Pure Film，此时无百分比显示）就可以使用 <code>Force Film</code> 得到 24p 的 clip，重新生成 d2v</li>\n<li>如果显示 Film 低于 95% 或显示 Video，应继续使用之前生成的 d2v</li>\n</ol>\n<p>其实 DGIndex 也提供了 cli，示例：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-text\"><span class=\"line\"><span>DGIndex.exe -i \"xx.ts\" -o \"xx\" -fo 0 -om 0</span></span></code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-i</code>：指定输入的文件路径</li>\n<li><code>-o</code>：指定输出的文件路径（包括文件名不包括文件扩展名）</li>\n<li><code>-fo</code>：Field Operation， 0、1、2 依次对应 Honor Pulldown Flags、Force Film、Ignore Pulldown Flags</li>\n<li><code>-om</code>：Output Method，0 -

LWLibavSource</h3>\n<p>在实际流程中，我们用到 DGMPGDec 的时候有点少，一是 OKE 没有支持，二是只能读取 MPEG-2。一般使用的还是在基础滤镜篇章源滤镜部分提到的  LWLibavSource，DGMPGDec 更多时候是用于验证与比对。主要是对于 LWLibavSource 参数 <code>repeat</code> 的使用，其他与加载常规视频源相同。<code>repeat</code> 只对含有 pulldown flags 的视频生效，也就是说如果视频中不含有 pulldown flags，<code>repeat</code> 的值无论为多少都会返回原本的视频。下面是不同 <code>repeat</code> 值对 soft pulldown 视频的处理。</p>\n<ol>\n<li>值为 <code>False</code> 或 <code>0</code> 时，不做任何处理，返回源视频，即\n<ul>\n<li>如果源是 24fps 和 30fps 混合返回帧率不明的 vfr clip</li>\n<li>如果源全是 24fps（也就是 pure film）返回 24p clip（与 DGIndex 的 <code>Force Film</code> 行为相同），但帧率不一定正确，可能需要 <code>std.AssumeFPS(fpsnum=24000, fpsden=1001)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>其他值时，像播放器一样根据 pulldown flags 对需要重复的场进行 repeat，如果成功则返回一个 30fps 的 clip（与 DGIndex 的 <code>Honor Pulldown Flags</code> 行为相同，但结果更为可靠），如果失败：\n<ul>\n<li>若值为 <code>True</code> 或 <code>1</code>，显式报错</li>\n<li>若值为 <code>2</code>，与 <code>0</code> 时相同，返回帧率不明的 vfr clip</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>pulldown flags 处理失败，可能是因为视频流破损、后期剪辑失误、超出 lsmas 处理能力等。<br />\n对于返回的 vfr clip 也需要仔细检查，看起来正常但不一定正确。<br />\n而且哪怕是 <code>repeat=1</code> 成功返回了 cfr clip，也要仔细检查帧顺序是否正确，如果出现问题可以从 <a href=\"https://github.com/AkarinVS/L-SMASH-Works/issues\">Github repo issues</a> 回报。</p>\n<p>在启用 <code>repeat</code> 时可以通过 frameprops <code>_EncodedFrameBottom</code> 和 <code>_EncodedFrameTop</code> 来查看当前帧由哪两场组成。同时 <code>.lwi</code> 文件中也记录了 rff 的信息，<code>Repeat=1</code> 为无 rff，<code>Repeat=2</code> 为 rff。</p>\n<p>总之，处理中一般应使用更为严格安全的 <code>repeat=1</code>（默认值），repeat 失败再使用 <code>repeat=0</code>。如果是查看老一些的脚本或使用旧版本的滤镜（vA.2 之前版本）时，你可能会发现 <code>repeat</code> 只有 True 与 False 两种，旧有的 True 就是现在的 <code>repeat=2</code>。再老一些，<code>repeat</code> 默认是 false，现在 <code>repeat</code> 默认是 1…</p>\n<h4 id=\"检测是否为全程-soft-pulldownpure-film\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#检测是否为全程-soft-pulldownpure-film\">#</a> 检测是否为全程 soft pulldown（pure film）</h4>\n<p>可以使用 DGIndex，也可以用以下方法。</p>\n<p>假设 repeat

<code>repeat=1</code>。~~当然就算是完美的 soft pulldown，开启 <code>repeat=1</code> 读取后再进行 IVTC 也没有问题。~~示例脚本：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

隔行扫描视频的常规处理</h2>\n<p>正常情况下，我们要将隔行扫描视频正确地处理回逐行视频再进行后续的处理，下面就说下如何处理，顺序还是依照上面 sample 的顺序。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-指定-fieldbased30p\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-指定-fieldbased30p\">#</a> (1). 指定 FieldBased（30p）</h3>\n<p>因为只是标记为 60i，视频本身仍为逐行扫描，所以只需要使用 <code>core.std.SetFieldBased(src, 0)</code> 将 Frameprops 中的 <code>_FieldBased</code> 标记为 0（Progressive）即可，通常在将隔行扫描的视频处理为逐行扫描的视频后都要如此操作，因为这样可以避免后续处理的滤镜读取到错误的 Frameprops 进行了错误的处理。</p>\n<p>缟缟的处理放到后面。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-deint30i\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-deint30i\">#</a> (2).

field=1)</code>，直接扔掉下半场，只用上半场插补出整帧，这样帧率保持不变，变为场率的一半。但这种直接没了一半信息的做法实在过于粗暴，所以我们可以先进行分场，再对每场进行插补，如下所示：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

上文已经说过，24t  的场排序为（1上，1下）、（2上，2下）、（2上，3下）、（3上，4下）、（4上，4下）。要想将其还原回 24p，就需要先进行场匹配（Frame Match）转换为  24d，即固定上半场不变，按规则与相邻帧的下半场进行组合，选择成品画面中拉丝最少的作为最终结果，变成了（1上，1下）、（2上，2下）、（2上，2下）、（3上，3下）、（4上，4下），最后以 5

部分所说，实际视频流中的 fps 不一定是恒定的，可能是时间上的多种类型的混合。也就是看起来是 60i  的视频，其中可能是 24d、30i、30p、24d  按时间的混合，这种时候应该对不同类型进行分别处理，最后再合并起来得到一个可变帧率（vfr）的视频。</p>\n<h4 id=\"timecode\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#timecode\">#</a>

还是其他压制者，很多会在发布页上写一点吐槽，说明自己做了些什么处理。然而，为什么压制者需要处理瑕疵呢？</p>\n<p>首先是观感的影响。“瑕疵”是一个很直觉的感受，我们即使不从一个科学的角度定义，也可以判断片源是否具有瑕疵。同样的，我们也能直觉地比较瑕疵“修复前”和“修复后”的改善。</p>\n<p>其次是编码的问题。假如“瑕疵”无法被肉眼在播放时察觉，我们是否应该修复呢？站在压制者的角度上，这个问题的答案通常是  Yes。原因是压制的本质是二次压缩，对于在第一次编码时引入的瑕疵，在第二次编码时会被当做输入来处理。结果就是瑕疵通常占用了不必要的空间，又或者在二次压缩时遭到强化。</p>\n<p>瑕疵修复是必定有副作用的。为了消除瑕疵，可以对画质做出多大的牺牲呢？</p>\n<p>这个问题并没有一个标准答案。画质的牺牲和瑕疵处理的完全度是一个取舍的关系。取舍的程度实际上就是每位压制者的核心烦恼。而瑕疵处理手段则决定了取舍的效率。本章会带大家了解多种瑕疵处理手段的效果和副作用，相信大家学完本章后会对这个问题有更深的体会。</p>\n<h2

<code>6</code>）会隐约看到头发的线条轮廓，但是其他纹理就几乎看不到了。</p>\n<p>而且如果切换回 nr16（<code>5</code> 号输出）和源（<code>0</code> 号输出）之间对比，线条的锐度差异就已经是很微小的差别了。</p>\n<p>重要的是，假如我们丢弃了这个分离出来的噪点层，对 nr16 进行一点点补偿性锐化，那么在肉眼看来，我们就是成功的移除了噪点瑕疵，而保留了线条锐度和纹理细节。</p>\n<p>然后，大家可以试着切换不同的帧看看。<br />\n举个例子，可以看 1988 帧，一个夕阳下的场景。</p>\n<p>比对 Bilateral 的 <code>4</code> 号输出和 dfttest 的 <code>6</code> 号输出，你会发现 dfttest 的噪点层仿佛保留了所有噪点，但是排除了近乎所有的纹理线条细节。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

号输出）可以看到：蓝天的噪点比较粗糙，两者噪点有点粗细不同的感觉。</p>\n<p>同一个画面下，其实噪点模样通常是不一致的。<br />\n在 2060 里，有些噪点比较细致，有些比较粗造（看起来像一堆重叠的方块，不是一个个独立的点）</p>\n<p>如果切换回 1988，这里的分别就更明显了。可以看到噪点呈大方格装的感觉，根本不是“噪点”。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/image_1988_1.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>这个观察反映出另一个要点：在我们接触到的大部分压制源上，<strong>噪点（噪声）跟 addgrain 的差别非常远</strong>。</p>\n<p>这证明了 denoise 并不是 addgrain 的一个逆操作。</p>\n<p>我们通常可以这样假设：<br />\n制作方使用了类似 addgrain 的操作，在经过第一次编码后，噪点丧失了原有的形态。<br />\n我们在压制处理时，就需要移除这些“残留物”，以防他们影响观感，或者占用码率。</p>\n<p>现在 dfttest 我们选用了 <code>sigma=8</code>，而作为课后练习，大家可以试试 sigma 取多少才更适合这份素材。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-nlmeans\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-nlmeans\">#</a> (5). nlmeans</h3>\n<p>接下来，我们来尝试本章要介绍的最后一个降噪滤镜，nlmeans。</p>\n<p>这里选用的是

2. 去色带 Deband</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-重温色带\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-重温色带\">#</a> (1). 重温色带</h3>\n<p>首先重温一下色带的现象，我们一般容易在一些低位深源的暗场颜色过渡区域看到色带。</p>\n<p>这里有两个要素，第一个是颜色过渡，第二个是低位深源。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/banding_colour.png\" alt=\"img\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/banding_image.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>在有颜色渐变的地方，无论亮场和暗场都容易出现色带。</p>\n<p>如果用图来显示，一个渐变区域可以画成这样：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/graph_00.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>X 轴是空间，而 Y 轴是像素的亮度。</p>\n<p>但是由于源的位深有限制，在编码后这条斜线会变成阶梯状：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/graph_01.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>每个阶梯对应一个整数的像素亮度。<br />\n当位深越低，阶梯之间的间隔就越大。<br />\n在达到某一个大的间隔后，人眼就能察觉并辨认为色带了。</p>\n<p>既然低位深容易产生色带，那么位深要到多少才不容易/不会有色带呢？<br />\n有人可能会说 10bit 是被认为是不容易出色带的，但是为什么呢？</p>\n<p>实际上这是个陷阱题。<br />\n8bit 容易出色带，10bit 不容易是基于经验的观察。<br />\n实际上无论位深有多高，阶梯是必定会出现的，只是间距会有差别。</p>\n<p>我们关注的纯粹是“以一般人类视觉而言，不容易察觉到色带的状况”。</p>\n<p>在 bt.709 色域下，工程师总结出 10bit-YUV 不容易产生人眼能察觉的色带。<br />\n而如果我们换成 HDR 色域的话，由于颜色范围的增大，通常被认为需要 12bit-YUV 才足够。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>位深不变的话，数量还是那么多，但范围大了，精度就变差了，所以可能需要提高位深来弥补。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>所以这里是第一个重点：<strong>色带处理的目标实际上是要骗过人的眼睛</strong>。<br />\n小色带是必定会存在的，只要无法被肉眼察觉就可以。</p>\n<p>接下来，我们说一下在维持位深不变的情况下，防止色带的原理。<br />\n这个方法我们统称为 <em>dithering</em> (抖动)。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/graph_02.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>如果在刚才的图上面表示，dither 大概看起来像这样。<br />\n透过在阶梯的两侧加入一些“上下抖动”的变化，我们让肉眼误认这是一段连续的颜色变化。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/banding_colour.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>实际效果就如上面红黑色的图一般。</p>\n<p>然而，加入抖动的副作用是，抖动本身看起来就像一些噪声，会让图像看起来有些粗糙。<br />\n这个可以用下图很好地说明。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/gif_22_07_25_00.gif\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>在这张 gif 里面，可以观察一下肉色的部分。<br />\n我们可以隐约看到三种肉色的变化，但是由于抖动的存在，看上去就像是连续的渐变色+上面有很重的动噪。<br />\n这种 dithering 有一个统称，叫 <em>random dithering</em>，意思是加进去的抖动有随机性，看起来像是噪声。</p>\n<p>而在下一幅 gif, 这里加入的是另一种形式的抖动，叫 <em>ordered dithering</em>。<br />\n大家会察觉到有一层难看的网格状噪点，这就是 ordered dither 的特色。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/gif_22_08_28_00.gif\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>原则来说，由于网格辣眼睛，我们会尽量选择 random dithering 作为去色带的手段。</p>\n<p>最后一幅的 gif，是用来说明我们日常会看到色带的情况。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/gif_23_01_03_00.gif\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>观察左上角这里，我们会看到虽然色带附近有抖动，但抖动似乎只存在于色带的边缘部分，并没有覆盖整个颜色变化区域。</p>\n<p>实际上，这种现象广泛出现在各种（BD）源里：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>尽管制作方即使加入了一点抖动，但是由于强度不足或者编码器不听话，抖动最终不足以掩盖色带。</li>\n<li>另一方面，色带的边缘也不会是很漂亮的，有连贯性的边缘。</li>\n</ul>\n<h3

/>\n<code>y</code>, <code>cb</code> 和 <code>cr</code> 分别对应 YUV 三个平面的去色带力度，而 <code>range</code> 是一个比较特殊的参数。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/graph_01.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>在这幅图，我们可以看到阶梯除了有高度（像素亮度）外，还有宽度。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/gif_23_01_03_00.gif\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>而从这幅图，我们吸取到的教训是抖动需要覆盖整个阶梯才行。</p>\n<p><code>range</code> 所决定的，简单来说就是抖动需要覆盖的范围。<br />\n视乎色带的宽度，我们会动态地调整 <code>range</code> 的大小。</p>\n<p>另一方面，连续进行两次 f3kdb 是我们的一个惯例。<br />\n这方法有两个好处，第一个是可以涵盖不同大小的色带，另一个是在处理大色带的时候，可以让效果看起来比较均匀。</p>\n<p>两次的 f3kdb 通常是 <code>range</code> 小的先行，大的在后；小的去色带力度给的较强，大的去色带力度给的较弱。<br />\n常见的 <code>range</code> 的配搭有 <code>8</code>+<code>16</code>, <code>12</code>+<code>24</code>, 或者 <code>16</code>+<code>31</code>, 选哪个视乎色带的形态。</p>\n<p>而去色带力度的话，通常较弱的 deband 我们会给

href=\"https://github.com/WolframRhodium/muvsfunc/blob/6203a71cc5aa8bba2f4f95afe3f61595f9ea0d84/muvsfunc.py#L500-L669\">这里</a>。</p>\n<p>GradFun3 的调参主要依靠 <code>thr</code> 和 <code>elast</code> 两个参数。</p>\n<p>这不是一个巧合，GradFun3 是利用了 LimitFilter 来调整 deband 效果大小。<br />\n由于源码比较复杂，而且大部分内容这里没有涉及，所以我们这里就不详细分析了。</p>\n<p>简化地说，GradFun3 是先利用 Bilateral 或者 DFTTest 对画面做一个模糊，然后做一个 detail/edge mask（遮罩）尝试保护纹理和线条。</p>\n<p>那么，默参的 GradFun3 能清干净 474 帧的色带吗？<br />\n观察后可以发现，不行。所以我们要增强一下 GradFun3 的威力。</p>\n<p>可以看到，它的默认参数是 <code>thr=0.35, elast=3.0</code>，那么试试填一个更强的参数？</p>\n<p>我们回顾一下 LimitFilter 的内容，LimitFilter 的特性主要是由 thr 和 thr*elast 来定义的。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>thr 定义什么值开始有削弱效果</li>\n<li>thr*elast 定义最大允许的变化值</li>\n</ul>\n<p>所以在调参的时候，你可以尝试：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>固定 thr*elast, 然后提高 thr</li>\n<li>固定 thr 和 elast 的相对比例，两个一起提升</li>\n</ol>\n<p>在 deband 的状况下，可能第一个状况比较贴合。不需要调整最大值，只需要调低 LimitFilter 的削弱效果。</p>\n<p>所以我们先试试用 <code>thr=0.7, elast=1.5</code> 的组合，再观察一下草地的变化。<br />\n可以看到，现在色带变得稍微不明显了一点，平滑了点，但好像还不太够。</p>\n<p>那么再提高点 elast, 比如说 <code>thr=0.7, elast=3.0</code> 呢？</p>\n<p>细心的同学可以看到，草坪和校舍的木纹都差不多要磨平了，但是草地中间这个分界线还是有点明显。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/image_474_0.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>然后切换到 1224 帧。<br />\n在 100% 缩放下，可以发现衣服上的（光照效果导致的）色带差不多已经擦干净了，但是放大仔细看还是有点残留。</p>\n<p>一个简单的总结，GradFun3 总而言之是比较难调参的。<br />\nthr 控制了 deband 最小的力度，thr*elast 控制了 deband 最大可以抹些什么。<br />\n另外其他可以改的参数都比较多。</p>\n<p>GradFun3 的出场通常是要牺牲大量细节也得抹色带的状况。它的最大效果就如同上一节降噪里，单独用 bilateral 轰纹理的状况。</p>\n<p>而另一方面，这个 MINORI 源是一个很好的参考例子，可以播一下这个片，你会发现大部分前景都是类似水彩的触感。</p>\n<p>比如说 321 帧，这个暗一点的地面，它上面的纹理可以说是水彩的笔触，也可以说是位深不足导致类似 GIF 的色带。因此要不要 deband 就成为一个两难问题了。</p>\n<p>这就回到了本小节开头的提问，对于这类水彩质感背景的画面，是否需要 deband 以及 deband 手段的强弱，是实际压制中需要仔细权衡的点。</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-抗锯齿-anti-aliasing\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-抗锯齿-anti-aliasing\">#</a> 3. 抗锯齿 Anti-Aliasing</h2>\n<p>锯齿（aliasing）这个现象想必大家都不陌生，用一个简单的图解的话，就是在斜线区域，因为像素呈方形，所以看上去像一些阶梯。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/aliasing.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>要解决锯齿需要抗锯齿（Anti-Aliasing）处理。</p>\n<p>Anti-Aliasing 的本质就是给梯级之间填充一些灰色，好让它在远处看起来是顺滑的，而不是一个锯子。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>细心的同学会发现，其实色带和锯齿是很类似的现象，两者都是一个平滑斜线的信息，因为分辨率或者位深有限，而变成的阶梯状。而修正的方法是给阶梯之间填充一些“过渡性”的信息。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"1-aa-效果\"><a

alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>其余的玩偶轮廓，还有小女孩，整体都是有一个锯齿的感觉。</p>\n<p>会有这种感觉，主要是因为制作方并非完全没有 Anti-Aliasing。<br />\n他们做出来的效果介乎于完全没有和做好之间（就像色带那样）。<br />\n所以才会有“锯齿感”，但又不是完全锯齿的感觉。</p>\n<p>然后，我们切换到输出 <code>3</code>，可以看到锯齿几乎都消失了。</p>\n<p>比如说书页顺滑了不少。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/image_882_1.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>不过，作为抗锯齿的代价，我们会觉得线条变糊了一点，少了一点锐利度。</p>\n<p>如果切换到 <code>4</code> 号输出，对比抗锯齿前后的 <code>aa_diff</code>，我们还能留意到在平面上有一点点噪点的存在。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/image_882_2.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>总而言之，抗锯齿的基本副作用就是：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>会抹除一点点高频信息</li>\n<li>会让线条的锐利度下降</li>\n</ol>\n<p>这两点整体来说是不难处理的：<br />\n1 的话，可以通过先降噪，来避免 AA 损伤高频信息。<br />\n2 的话，可以通过补偿性锐化，来补足线条失去的锐利度（而不还原锯齿）。</p>\n<p>再延伸一下，AA 在特性上是一个很弱的 blur，或者说是一个低通滤镜。他会糊掉一点点的噪点，但是大部分的噪点和纹理细节等它都不会动。</p>\n<p>所以在一般情况下，如果需要保留噪点的话，那就先 denoise，然后 aa，最后将噪点层 mergediff 回去便是。在丢弃噪点层（如 webrip）的状况下，AA 的副作用基本可以无视。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-aa-原理\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-aa-原理\">#</a> (2). AA 原理</h3>\n<p>正如上面所讲，AA 需要给两个阶梯中间补足一点过渡的信息。</p>\n<p>于是很久以前的压制者想到利用 <em>deinterlacing</em> (反交错) 滤镜来实现这个功能。</p>\n<p>交错源的特性是画面宽度不变，但是高度减少一半。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/interlacing.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>反交错滤镜的工作就是想办法把缺失的一半补回来，所以反交错滤镜的本质也是一个倍高的滤镜。</p>\n<p>而反交错滤镜，比起普通的 resizer 有一个额外的功能，就是它会尝试做一个“连线”的动作。</p>\n<p>我们假设画面有一条斜线，中间缺失的部分，是因为进行 interlacing 的时候被丢弃了。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/deint_00.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>如果是普通的 resize 的话，它会尝试延长上下的直线，导致接合的地方有一个断裂。<br />\n这个是我们不想看到的。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/deint_01.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>相反，如果是 deinterlacer 的话，它会尝试将黑线断开的部分连接，尝试还原一个连续的线条。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/deint_02.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>所以我们可以这样利用 deinterlacer：<br />\n假设中间有个空隙，强行让 deinterlacer 补上。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/deint_03.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>最后再缩回原分辨率，获得一个比之前少一点锯齿感的输出。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/deint_04.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>我们说完原理，接下来就可以看代码了。</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

就行。</p>\n<p>这个说法只对了一半，确实 AA 过程是平面独立的，每个平面都应该各自移动 0.5px。但是注意到在调用 resizer 时，所给的 shift 参数的像素距离是以 Y 平面为准的。</p>\n<p>这意味着在 YUV420 时，虽然 UV 平面也需要移动 0.5px，但转换到 Y 平面的像素距离时，数值就发生了一定的变化，这时应该给到 <code>sy=[-0.5,

这三个输出，看看有什么差别。<br />\n有需要的话，也可以用 <code>4</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>8</code> 这几个 aadiff 辅助。</p>\n<p>由于 deint 滤镜本身的特性, eedi2-aa 效果通常是最糊的；<br />\nnnedi3 出来的效果最锐，但是 aa 的力度也最弱；<br />\needi3 的性质在这个源中比较难体现出来，它的效果介乎两者之间。</p>\n<p>实际上 eedi3 的连线能力最强，针对下图左边这种完全没有 AA 过的线条（我们称为<em>二值化线条</em>）的效果最好。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-09/aliasing.jpg\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>所以在实际使用上，比较糊的源我们会选用 eedi2-aa；作画分辨率比较高的我们会选 nnedi3-aa；而特殊情况我们会选用 eedi3-aa。</p>\n<p>最后我们讨论下 AA 滤镜的弱点：</p>\n<p>第一个可以参考<a href=\"https://bbs.acgrip.com/thread-8413-1-1.html\">这里</a>，正如观众提醒的，灯子旁边的下水道花了。</p>\n<p>我们知道 deint 滤镜会有连线的作用，所以在密集的斜线中，偶然会有错连的情况出现。</p>\n<p>AA 操作最后接的 repair(2) 主要是为了修复、弱化这种错误连线的视觉效果。</p>\n<p>而另一个弱点的话，大家可以移动到 2159 帧，然后放大到 400%，比对一下源和 nnedi3-aa 的效果。</p>\n<p>就算是效果最弱的 nnedi3-aa, 也对细节有明显的破坏，而且并不是什么 AA 效果，大多是变糊，变灰之类的副作用。</p>\n<p>主要原因是，deint-AA 处理出现当初，针对的都是一些比较糊的源，原生分辨率最高可能也就 720。</p>\n<p>但是近年多了很多作画精细的番，示例中的 clockwork planet 我们认为它是接近 1080p 的原生分辨率。</p>\n<p>所以一开始说到，AA 处理会带有一点点 blur 的副作用，在这里就显示的很明显了。<br />\n虽然在 100% 下差别不算大。</p>\n<p>因此在遇到高作画精度的番时，有时候会考虑完全不做 AA，抗锯齿的代价太大，补偿性锐化也不能将上述的细节还原。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-高强度-aa-sangnom\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-高强度-aa-sangnom\">#</a> (5). 高强度 AA —— SangNom</h3>\n<p>先载入源

/>\n<code>uh = h * 3 // 2</code><br />\n<code>uw</code>, <code>uh</code> 这里指定了放大的幅度，正如前面说的，我们先设 1.5 倍。</p>\n<p><code>aa_clip = core.eedi2.EEDI2(src16, field=1)</code><br />\n<code>aa_clip = core.fmtc.resample(aa_clip, w, uh, sy = [-0.5, -1]).std.Transpose()</code><br />\n<code>aa_clip = core.eedi2.EEDI2(aa_clip, field=1)</code><br />\n<code>aa_clip = core.fmtc.resample(aa_clip, uh, uw, sy = [-0.5, -1])</code><br />\n这里的四行跟前面说的有点类似。</p>\n<p>都是先用 EEDI2 (或者 nnedi3) 倍高，然后缩回去目标的分辨率（1.5x）并且修正偏移。</p>\n<p><code>.fmtc.bitdepth(bits=8)</code><br />\n是一个优化步骤。</p>\n<p>大多数 deint 滤镜是设计给 8bit 输入用的，给 16bit 输入除了拖慢以外，不会有什么画质上的帮助。<br />\n另一方面 AA 不太受位深精度影响。</p>\n<p><code>aa_clip = core.sangnom.SangNom(aa_clip, aa=48, dh=False).std.Transpose()</code><br />\n<code>aa_clip = core.sangnom.SangNom(aa_clip, aa=48, dh=False)</code> 接下来的就跟之前一样。</p>\n<p><code>aa_clip = core.fmtc.resample(aa_clip, 1920, 1080)</code><br />\n再缩回去原分辨率。</p>\n<p>这里思考一个问题，为什么不需要给 <code>sy=-0.5</code> 呢？</p>\n<p>&lt;details class=&quot;details_lb9f isBrowser_bmU9 alert alert--info details_b_Ee&quot; data-collapsed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;summary&gt;参考答案&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/details&gt;</p>\n<p>事实上只有 dh=True 倍高的时候才会引入像素偏移，在 dh=False 丢弃半场再插回半场的情况下，并不会改变最终分辨率，也不会引入偏移。</p>\n<p>这个 SangNom 的使用例子，能够调节的参数是 <code>uw</code>, <code>uh</code>。</p>\n<p>作为一个基本规则：<br />\nAA 处理的<strong>输入分辨率越高</strong>，<br />\nAA 效果的<strong>强度越弱</strong>。</p>\n<p>假如我们将 <code>uw</code> 设为 <code>w*2</code>，放大 2 倍的话，可以观察到 AA 效果变弱了一点，但还是基本足够消除这画面的锯齿。</p>\n<p>而另一方面，SangNom(dh=False) 的瑕疵主要来自丢弃半场的特性，所以可以透过放大来缓解一部分瑕疵。<br />\n因为可以让下半场的信息“复制”到邻接的两行里，避免了下半场信息的完全丢失。</p>\n<p>既然多了调整分辨率这个操作，大家想象一下，有什么方法可以增强 SangNom 的 AA 效果吗？</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

效果。</p>\n<p>当然除非做一些老番，强力 AA 是不会怎么用上的。<br />\n我们讲 SangNom 是因为偶然会遇到这种，低分辨率强行 upconv 到 BD 1080P 的烂源。</p>\n<p>那么，我们可以连续做两次 AA 来增强 AA 的效果吗？</p>\n<p>连续多次 AA 是可以的，不过每 AA 一次，线也会更糊一些，瑕疵也更容易累积。</p>\n<p>所以要用的小心（比如说较小的文字，书本报章之类的，很容易受到多次 AA 的摧残）。</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-瑕疵修复流程\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-瑕疵修复流程\">#</a> 4. 瑕疵修复流程</h2>\n<p>比起独立的瑕疵处理步骤，一个完整脚本还需要考虑各个步骤的先后次序和连接。</p>\n<p>按照本章学到的内容，deband, denoise 和 AA 应该按什么次序处理呢？</p>\n<p>AA -&gt; denoise -&gt; deband ?<br />\ndenoise -&gt; deband -&gt; AA ?</p>\n<p>deband 如同前面说的，要放在 denoise 之后，但是 AA 就有点尴尬了。</p>\n<p>AA 放在 denoise 前的话，可能会影响被噪点干扰（AA 有微弱的 blur 效果）。<br />\n放在 deband 后面的话，又怕 AA 会不会干扰 deband 的 dither 效果（dither 也是一种噪声）。</p>\n<p>所以这里更推荐先 denoise，然后分别对 nr16 进行 deband 和 AA，最后找个办法将 AA 和 Deband 两者融合回来。<br />\n毕竟 Deband 应该只作用于平面，AA 只作用于线条，两者之间没有依赖关系。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>在高阶处理中，就不再限于这样的顺序，因为可以通过 mask 等手段只对希望的部分进行处理。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>这里分享一个 webrip 的范例脚本

Resizer应用</h2>\n<p>首先登场的是两位老朋友：<a href=\"https://amusementclub.github.io/fmtconv/doc/fmtconv.html\"><code>fmtconv</code></a> 和 <a href=\"https://amusementclub.github.io/doc/functions/video/resize.html?highlight=resize#resize\"><code>zimg</code></a>，复习一下，调用他们分别使用<code>vs.core.fmtc.xxx</code>和<code>vs.core.resize.xxx</code>。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-平移和裁剪shift-crop\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-平移和裁剪shift-crop\">#</a> (1). 平移和裁剪（shift &amp; crop）</h3>\n<p>此处我们使用到的参数有以下几个：<code>zimg</code>对应的参数是<code>src_left</code>/<code>src_top</code>/<code>src_width</code>/<code>src_height</code>。<code>fmtconv</code>中对应的函数是<code>fmtc.resample</code>，参数分别对应<code>sx</code>/<code>sy</code>/<code>sh</code>/<code>sw</code>。这四个参数表示，输出结果对应着原图中的这样一个长方形区域——它左上顶点坐标是 (src_left,src_top)(src_left,src_top)，宽为 src_widthsrc_width，高为 src_heightsrc_height。如下图所示：</p>\n<p>![Sampling Zone](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure</a> 1.png)采样区域图示</p>\n<p>图中较大的长方形框是原始图像，较小的长方形框——也即<strong>采样区域</strong>，对应结果图像。<br />\n所以，如果想将图像向右平移10.5个像素，同时向下平移20个像素——此时我们的小方框顶点应该位于 (−10.5,−20)(−10.5,−20)，所以对应的写法是<code>resize.Spline36(src_left=-10.5, src_top=-20)</code>。同样的，我们还可以使用这个方法进行裁切，比如原图是 1920×10801920×1080，我想上切10像素，下切20像素，那么就是<code>resize.Spline36(src_top=10, src_height=1050)</code>。</p>\n<p>那么，假如“小方框”的某一条边落在“大方框”之外（所以前者其实可以比后者大，图中的“大” “小”只是为了便于理解）会怎么样呢？这里两个滤镜的行为出现了差别，超出边缘的像素，<code>zimg</code>会以图像的边缘作为对称轴，镜像补全；而<code>fmtconv</code>会重复边缘的像素来补全。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-尺寸变换resize\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-尺寸变换resize\">#</a> (2). 尺寸变换（resize）</h3>\n<p>此即图像的放大和缩小，或者说改变采样点（像素）的数量。滤镜依旧是上面所说的两个，<code>zimg</code>使用<code>width</code>/<code>height</code>指定输出图像的尺寸，<code>fmtconv</code>对应的是<code>w</code>/<code>h</code>。该操作将上面提到的<strong>采样区域</strong>（即由<code>src_left</code>/<code>src_top</code>/<code>src_width</code>/<code>src_height</code>指定的）缩放到<code>width</code>x<code>height</code>大小。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-fmtconv的逐平面处理\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-fmtconv的逐平面处理\">#</a> (3). <code>fmtconv</code>的逐平面处理</h3>\n<p>在使用<code>fmtc.resample</code>时，<code>sx</code>/<code>sy</code>/<code>sh</code>/<code>sw</code>可以传一个数组进去，数组依次指定指定3个平面的参数，例如<code>fmtc.resample(sx=[-1,0,1])</code>。假如数组长度为2，比如<code>sx=[-1,0]</code>，那么第2、3平面共用数组内第二个参数。</p>\n<p>除此之外，<code>fmtconv</code>还有<code>planes</code>这个参数，也是传一个数组，具体含义doc里有写：</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This array decribes how each plane should be processed. It’s similar to the y, u and v parameters in Masktools 2.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>−65535 to +0.5: All the pixels of the plane will be set to −x (the opposite of  the specified value). The range depends on the output data type.  Remember, in floating-point YUV, the chroma planes range from −0.5 to  +0.5.</li>\n<li>1:\tThe plane will not be processed. This means that the content of the output plane is pure garbage.</li>\n<li>2: The plane of the input clip will be copied and possibly cropped. Areas  out of the input picture are left unprocessed (garbage). Range (full or  TV) conversions are ignored.</li>\n<li>3:\tThe plane will be processed (default).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>所以，假如你发现一个视频有 chroma shift，又不想把平面都拆出来，处理完再拼回去，那么你可以用<code>fmtc.resample(sx=0.3, plane=[2,3,3])</code>来仅仅处理色度平面。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-matrix转换\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-matrix转换\">#</a> (4). Matrix转换</h3>\n<p>这个其实没啥好说的，<code>fmtconv</code>用<code>fmtc.matrix</code>和<code>fmtc.matrix2020cl</code>，参数的意义在doc里写得都挺明白。<code>zimg</code>则是整合到了各个采样滤镜中，用<code>matrix_in</code>/<code>matrix</code>来指定输入和输出，不过这俩参数只能传数字，更推荐的写法是用<code>_s</code>结尾的参数<code>matrix_in_s</code>/<code>matrix_s</code>传入字符串，看得更加清晰。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-transfer转换\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-transfer转换\">#</a> (5). Transfer转换</h3>\n<p>除了<code>fmconv</code>用<code>fmtc.transfer</code>之外，用法和上面没啥区别。。。但是有几个需要注意的地方：</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>zimg</code>的<code>709</code>实际上是<code>bt1886</code>，和<code>fmtconv.transfer</code>中的<code>1886</code>对应，而不是<code>709</code>。</li>\n<li><strong>注意range</strong>，这一点要特别注意，因为<code>fmtconv</code>中默认输入输出都是 <code>full range</code>。于是假如你传进去一个<code>limited range</code> 的Y平面，然后没指定<code>fulls=False</code>，结果就错了。</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"6-gamma-awara-resize\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#6-gamma-awara-resize\">#</a> (6). Gamma awara-resize</h3>\n<p>下图是一些 Transer的曲线，这里我们从图上直观地理解一下：横轴代表计算机里储存的数，纵轴代表实际的显示亮度，可以很明显地发现：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>这些曲线都不是线性的（废话）。</li>\n<li>他们都是下凹的，也就是说暗场给了更多的数字来表示。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure</a> 2.jpeg)</p>\n<p>那么我们想象一下，假如说我们在用双线性算法缩小图像的时候，在 <code>full range 8bit</code>下，有两个像素：0和255，那么在他们中点插值的像素值将会是128，我们姑且认为我们将这两个像素合并成了一个，那么按理说，视觉上应该是得到中性灰。但是由于 transfer 曲线将0-255中更多的数字给了暗场，所以得到的 128 会比中性灰更暗。其他的 kernel  大同小异。这么做的后果是图像的对比度会下降，比如这张图：</p>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure</a> 3.png)</p>\n<p>直接缩到1/4大小，会得到：</p>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure</a> 4.png)</p>\n<p>可以明显感觉灯光的对比度低了。诚然，resizer自带的low-pass效应是一点，tranfer压缩是另一点。</p>\n<p>那么怎么办呢？我们可以将图像转到线性光下，再做resize，然后转回transfer压缩的效果。还是那张图，如果在线性光下做：</p>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-08/Figure</a> 5.png)</p>\n<p>vs中，可以这样写：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light

，只用Y'做转换不太准确。你可以看到UV计算，是基于transfer压缩后的RGB。如果RGB本身是未压缩的线性光，UV的值会有改变；虽然YUV的机制保证了它改变的不大。理想的YUV机制，应该完全消除掉亮度在UV平面的影响，也就是对亮度进行统一的变换。UV的值不应该改变（注意它是亮度做差）。这是理想中情况，现实中很难做到。</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-chroma-subsample-与-chroma-placement\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#7-chroma-subsample-与-chroma-placement\">#</a> (7). Chroma subsample 与 Chroma placement</h3>\n<p>前文提到过，YUV空间下的色度平面中心可能会出现和亮度平面不一致的情况（Chroma subsample），利用resizer可以对这些不同的采样进行转换。如果是无脑调用滤镜的话，<code>zimg</code>用<code>format</code>参数指定输出的格式（同时也就指定了色度采样类型），<code>fmtconv</code>则使用<code>css</code>单独表示输出的色度采样类型。即使有这些看上去很方便的工具，但我们还是要打开黑匣子——如果给你一个YUV420的视频，让你手动放大UV，转成YUV444，你要怎么操作？</p>\n<p>上文所提到的两个resizer，默认是中心对齐的放大，例如：</p>\n<p>原本的3个像素采样位置是 [2,4,6][2,4,6]，中点为4；放大后采样位置变成了 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7][1,2,3,4,5,6,7]，中点还是4。</p>\n<p>如果YUV420是MPEG1的cplace。那么你直接可以将UV放大到两倍：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

/></p>\n<p>所有黑点，是Y的采样位置；蓝色的点，是MPEG2下，UV的采样位置；红色的是MPEG1下的位置；我们希望调整到红色。那么就需要把UV，向右移动Y的尺度下的0.5像素，这0.5像素就是红点和蓝点之间的距离；那么在UV的尺度下，这0.5就变成了0.25。所以如果是MPEG2的cplace，在resize的时候：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki

RemoveGrain</h3>\n<p>Blurring，意为模糊，这里介绍一个新的基础滤镜——<code>RemoveGrain</code>，调用它的方式是<code>vs.core.rgvs.RemoveGrain()</code>，他是avs的<code>RgTools</code>在vs中的移植，可以在<a href=\"http://avisynth.nl/index.php/RgTools\">这里</a>找到他和其他同样在<code>RgTools</code>里的滤镜doc。下面来讲讲模糊的基本方法。</p>\n<h4 id=\"平均值模糊average-blur\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#平均值模糊average-blur\">#</a> 平均值模糊（Average Blur）</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/Noise_graph-cb8998cb565c1afd7e6093c3699e06d4.png\" alt=\"Figure 6\" /></p>\n<p>上面这些起起伏伏可以看作是噪点，所谓降噪，就是要把它抹平，那么最简单的，把所有点的值做个平均填回去：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/Average_deblur-45d1aaf28b8b9fa801a4bc58e45fd70a.png\" alt=\"Figure 7\" /></p>\n<p>好，非常平,马赛克大概就是这么做的，把某一区域所有像素的值取个平均。我们在vs中也可以做类似的事情，<code>core.rgvs.RemoveGrain(src, 20)</code>。它做的是：把某个像素取值变成 它和周围8个像素的平均值，这里一共有9个像素参与了计算。比如极端一点的情况，某个像素是10，周围8个像素是1，那么经过<code>RemoveGrain(20)之后，这个像素就变成了2</code>。</p>\n<p>这种操作太糊了，我们想要一个稍微弱一点的模糊。最简单的想法：我把中间那个像素的权重提高一点，这就是<code>RemoveGrain(11)</code>。具体权重的取值是：</p>\n<p>[1161811618141811618116]⎣</p>\n<p>⎡1618116181418116181161⎦</p>\n<p>⎤</p>\n<p>就是说中间的像素乘以1/4、加上中心十字的四个像素乘以1/8、加上四个角的四个像素乘以1/16。 把权重加起来是1，说明这是个unbiased的操作。可以用vs试试<code>RemoveGrain(11)</code>，看看是不是要比20清晰一点。类似的还有:<code>RemoveGrain(19)</code>： 权重是：</p>\n<p>[18181818018181818]⎣</p>\n<p>⎡81818181081818181⎦</p>\n<p>⎤</p>\n<p>可以想见这个会比20还要糊。 以上三种，叫Average Blur，用平均值进行模糊。既然可以用平均值，我们不难想到另一个经常和平均值一起出现的中位数。</p>\n<h4 id=\"中位数模糊median-blur\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#中位数模糊median-blur\">#</a> 中位数模糊（Median Blur）</h4>\n<p>中位数，同样的，我们可以取一个像素和周围八个像素总计9个像素的中位数。这就是RemoveGrain(4)。另外还有三个采用这种思路的模糊滤镜，分别是1，2，3。首先我们把周围8个像素的值排序，我们把mode的值叫做a，要是中间像素的值在排序中，比第a大的值还要大，就把它换成这个第a大的值；如果比第a小的值还要小，就把他换成这个第a小的值。 比如：</p>\n<p>[593726148]⎣</p>\n<p>⎡571924368⎦</p>\n<p>⎤</p>\n<p>然后我们的mode设置为1，2并不比1小也不比9大，什么都不会发生。mode为2，2正好是第2小的，什么都不会发生。mode为3，2终于比3要小了，所以中间2会变成3。变成：</p>\n<p>[593736148]⎣</p>\n<p>⎡571934368⎦</p>\n<p>⎤</p>\n<p>同理，那么<code>mode</code>为4，2就会变成5。然后不难证明，假如<code>mode</code>是4，中间那个像素永远会变成中央加周边总共9个像素的中位数。从刚才这个流程里我们可以看到，随着<code>mode</code>从1到4，原来在9个像素里面比较小的2逐渐变大了，也就是说模糊的效果逐渐加强了。</p>\n<p>然后，<code>RemoveGran</code>的<code>mode</code>参数是可以接受数组的，最多不超过<code>src</code>的平面数目，假如不足<code>src</code>的平面数目的话，那么滤镜会自动把<code>mode</code>扩展成一个长度为3的数组。例如<code>src</code>有三个平面，<code>mode</code>是1，那么滤镜会自动把<code>mode</code>扩展成一个长度为3的数组<code>[1,1,1]</code>，假如<code>mode</code>是<code>[20, 1]</code>那么滤镜会会把它变成<code>[20,1,1]</code>，总而言之就是重复的是数组最后一个数。这三个数对应着<code>RemoveGrain</code>会用什么样的<code>mode</code>去对<code>src</code>的三个平面做模糊。例如<code>[20, 1, 1]</code>，就意味着对Y平面用20，对UV平面用1。</p>\n<h4 id=\"中值模糊-vs-中位数模糊\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#中值模糊-vs-中位数模糊\">#</a> 中值模糊 vs 中位数模糊</h4>\n<p>Average Blur &amp; Median Blur 这两大类的滤镜的适用范围不太一样。比如下面这个极端情况：</p>\n<p>[00001000000]⎣</p>\n<p>⎡00001000000⎦</p>\n<p>⎤</p>\n<p>用 RG4 会把中间的100直接变成0；用 RG20 则会把中间变成11。</p>\n<p>再比如这里有一根线：</p>\n<p>[010001000100]⎣</p>\n<p>⎡000101010000⎦</p>\n<p>⎤</p>\n<p>假如用 RG4 的话，中间会变成0，表现为特别细的线会直接被抹掉，这也就是中位数模糊不太适用的场景。</p>\n<p>还有一种很特殊的噪声，称为椒盐噪声，像这样 <s>撒盐图中差可拟</s>：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/Salt-and-pepper_noise-bf6c8d834f8743b7b5659a941df44b66.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 8\" /></p>\n<p>RG4会直接把它抹平，RG20还会残留一点。而这种情况下我们一般倾向于抹平，所以中位数模糊是很合适的：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/Median_blur_for_Salt-and-pepper_noise-d8472f472072d0ed03d6e97fb6748790.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 9\" /></p>\n<p>假如用平均值模糊的话，会变成这样：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/Average_blur_for_Salt-and-pepper_noise-ad2d28811f2ea73ca246d70b1a04823d.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 10\" /></p>\n<p>比较丑陋。</p>\n<p>但就像刚才提到，在普通的图像中中位数模糊对于画面的破坏是比较大的，因此总的还是突出一个综合考虑。然后<a href=\"https://github.com/HomeOfVapourSynthEvolution/havsfunc\"><code>havsfunc</code></a>里面，就有这么一个综合考虑的滤镜，<code>MinBlur</code>，会选取两种方式中破坏较小的那种，并跟上一些后处理，具体可以看其中的代码。</p>\n<h4 id=\"自定义平均权重\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#自定义平均权重\">#</a> 自定义平均权重</h4>\n<p>对于以上提到的平均值模糊，对图像处理熟悉的同学会发现其实就是用一个 3×33×3 的核（kernel）进行卷积，如果我们想自己设定权重该怎么办呢？可以用<a href=\"https://amusementclub.github.io/doc/functions/video/convolution.html?highlight=conv#std.Convolution\"><code>vs.core.std.Convolution()</code></a>，用<code>matrix</code>参数传入卷积核，会比<code>rgvs</code>快一些。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-usmunsharp-mask\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-usmunsharp-mask\">#</a> (2). USM（Unsharp Mask）</h3>\n<h4 id=\"clip的简单运算\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#clip的简单运算\">#</a> clip的简单运算</h4>\n<p>我们可以对两个clip进行一些简单的运算：拥有相同帧序号的相同平面之间，进行逐像素的运算——这自然要求两个clip之间的格式和分辨率要是相同的。这里举一些滤镜来实现：</p>\n<h5 id=\"vscorestdmergeclipa-clipb-weight\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#vscorestdmergeclipa-clipb-weight\">#</a> <a href=\"https://amusementclub.github.io/doc/functions/video/merge.html?\"><code>vs.core.std.Merge(clipa, clipb, weight)</code></a>：</h5>\n<p>这里表示对<code>clipa</code>和<code>clipb</code>进行线性的融合，结果可以表示成 (1−weight)×clipa+weight×clipb(1−weight)×clipa+weight×clipb 。比如<code>weight=0</code>时，结果就是<code>clipa</code>；<code>weight=1</code>时，结果就是<code>clipb</code>；</p>\n<h5 id=\"vscorestdmakediffclipa-clipb\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#vscorestdmakediffclipa-clipb\">#</a> <a href=\"https://amusementclub.github.io/doc/functions/video/makediff.html\"><code>vs.core.std.MakeDiff(clipa, clipb)</code></a>以及<a href=\"https://amusementclub.github.io/doc/functions/video/mergediff.html\"><code>vs.core.std.Mergediff(clipa, clipb)</code></a>：</h5>\n<p>这两个滤镜分别表示 clipa−clipbclipa−clipb和 clipa+clipbclipa+clipb，注意，和<code>std.Merge()</code>不同，这里相加减可能会超出整数的范围。所以假如你传入的是整数类型的clip，做减法的时候<code>std.MakeDiff()</code>会加上一个中点的偏置，比如8bit视频会加上128；做加法的时候<code>std.MergeDiff()</code>会减去一个中点的偏置，比如8bit视频会减去128。当然这并不能完全解决超出范围的问题，不过好在我们直接做差的视频一般是比较相似的，所以一般没事，如果你实在不放心，可以转成浮点再做。</p>\n<h4 id=\"分离噪点层\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#分离噪点层\">#</a> 分离噪点层</h4>\n<p>会对clip进行简单的运算后，我们来进行一组操作：首先对 src 进行一个 RG11 ,可以想见，结果比较糊、噪点比较少，就叫 blur；然后用<code>MakeDiff</code>做 src−blursrc−blur ，就得到了噪点层—— blur 和 src 的差异。</p>\n<h4 id=\"unsharp-mask\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#unsharp-mask\">#</a> Unsharp Mask</h4>\n<p>然后，我们将这个噪点层——它包含了原图比较多的高频信息，用<code>MergeDiff</code>加到 src 上，这就是最简单且副作用爆炸的锐化：Unsharp  Mask。这玩意儿的副作用包括但不限于：ringing，aliasing，爆炸的噪点。这玩意儿就是photoshop的usm。但也是有好处的，黑色的线条看起来更黑了，纹理更清晰了，这也是我们后续所有锐化手段的基础。我们需要对它做各种限制，希望尽量保留下它的锐化效果又能消除多余的ringing之类的东西。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-sbr\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-sbr\">#</a> (3).

Repair</h2>\n<p>这一节要引进一个新的滤镜——<a href=\"http://avisynth.nl/index.php/RgTools/Repair\"><code>vs.core.rgvs.Repair(clip, ref, mode)</code></a>， 我们一般用 mode 1~4——mode N 表示，clip 的某个像素，倘若超出 ref 对应像素及其周围8个像素中 [[第NN小,,第NN大]]，这个范围，那么就取 ref中，这九个像素的 第N小/第N大。这个感觉和<code>RemoveGrain</code>有点像——RG做的是：每一个像素，相比于自己周边8个像素，不要太过分；<code>Repair</code>做的是，clip 的每一个像素，相比于 ref 的9个像素，不要太过分。这种操作经常用于可能引入突兀瑕疵的 clip。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-deringing\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-deringing\">#</a> (1). Deringing</h3>\n<p>知道了 Repair 有这个功能，我们就来看看它为啥可以做 de-ringing。</p>\n<p>一条 2px 宽度的黑色线条，如果周边都是灰色的像素。那么扁平化了看，像素的值是：</p>\n<p>[128,128,128,16,16,128,128][128,128,128,16,16,128,128]</p>\n<p>中间两个16是黑色，周边是128的灰色。ringing发生的时候，会变成这样：</p>\n<p>[128,128,160,16,16,160,128][128,128,160,16,16,160,128]</p>\n<p>直观的看就是裹着线条的像素值变得更剧烈了。Repair做的，就是看 clip 的每个像素，是不是值偏高或者偏低，比如 160，对应源周边的像素，要么是128要么是16，显然已经高了，就把它限制为最高值，如果不超过范围就不处理，跟RemoveGrain一样。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-non-ringing-upscale\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-non-ringing-upscale\">#</a> (2).

LimitFilter</h2>\n<p>上一节提到，Repair根据周边像素的相对大小来限制 ref 和 src 的区别不能过大。LimitFilter则是比较像素本体数值，跟一个阈（yù）值，以及允许的弹性程度作比较。最早来自于avs的dither package，现在则是一般用<code>mvf.LimitFilter</code>。用法<code>mvf.LimitFilter(flt, src, thr, elast)</code>。其中， <code>flt</code> 是要处理的clip；<code>src</code>是原始的clip；<code>thr</code>是一个阈值，表示8bit下，flt 和 src 可以差别多大。通常取值在0.5~3.0左右，表示8bit下允许偏移这么多。小数不用担心，内部运算精度是16bit的；<code>elast</code>，是弹性值，我们随后说。</p>\n<p>这里举个简单例子来说明它的作用表现，假设src的某个像素是50,<code>thr=0.5, elast=2.0</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>∣flt−src∣&lt;=thr∣flt−src∣&lt;=thr，直接保留。比如说 flt=49.8 或者 50.4，那么不做调整；</li>\n<li>∣flt−src∣&gt;thr×elast∣flt−src∣&gt;thr×elast，直接取值 src。比如说 flt=48.9 或者 51.7，那么直接设置为 50；</li>\n<li>thr&lt;∣flt−src∣&lt;thr×elastthr&lt;∣flt−src∣&lt;thr×elast ， 结果会被连续地调整到 [src−thr×elast24×(elast−1),src+thr×elast24×(elast−1)][src−thr×4×(elast−1)elast2,src+thr×4×(elast−1)elast2] 之间: final=src+(flt−src)×thr×elast−∣flt−src∣thr×elast−thrfinal=src+(flt−src)×thr×elast−thrthr×elast−∣flt−src∣。</li>\n</ol>\n<p>比如 flt=49.1，调整结果大约为 49.8；flt=50.6，调整结果大约为 50.5。</p>\n<p>综合以上，在<code>thr=0.5, elast=2.0</code>时，我们可以画出这个图：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/LimitFilter_0.5_2-945f8a18041ac8e274335a308bf4a78e.png\" alt=\"Figure 16\" /></p>\n<p>可以看到在<code>thr=0.5, elast=2.0</code>下。滤镜保证 ∣final−src∣&lt;=0.5∣final−src∣&lt;=0.5。</p>\n<p>elast&lt;=2elast&lt;=2 的时候，有个很巧的结论，就是 ∣final−src∣&lt;=thr∣final−src∣&lt;=thr。如果调整后出现 ∣final−src∣&gt;thr∣final−src∣&gt;thr，则一定是 elast&gt;2elast&gt;2 才会出现。（你可以通过一些简单的计算证明这个结论）</p>\n<p>这里再贴上一些不同参数下的曲线以供比较：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/assets/images/LimitFilter_Combined-6fe4588ee81433a7fdac6001d6521194.png\" alt=\"Figure 17\" /></p>\n<p>除此之外，LimitFilter还有一些例如<code>ref</code>的参数，因为一般用不到且原理大差不差，就不交代了，下面给出<code>mvf.LimitFilter</code>的完整计算过程。</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-text\"><span class=\"line\"><span>## Algorithm for Y/R/G/B plane (for chroma, replace \"thr\" and \"brighten_thr\" with \"thrc\")</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##     dif = flt - src</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##     dif_ref = flt - ref</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##     dif_abs = abs(dif_ref)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##     thr_1 = brighten_thr if (dif > 0) else thr</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##     thr_2 = thr_1 * elast</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##     if dif_abs &#x3C;= thr_1:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##         final = flt</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##     elif dif_abs >= thr_2:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##         final = src</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##     else:</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>##         final = src + dif * (thr_2 - dif_abs) / (thr_2 - thr_1)</span></span></code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"1-limitfilter-与-usm\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-limitfilter-与-usm\">#</a> (1). LimitFilter 与 USM</h3>\n<p>第一个用途，我们可以用LimitFilter来限制USM的副效果，例如<code>LimitFilter(thr=3.0, elast=4.0)</code>。上节提到了 ModerateSharpening——<code>Repair(usm, src, 1)</code>。事实上用 LimitFilter  效果更好，可以选择控制的参数也更多。不只是处理锐化，AA、dering，以及很多破坏性处理，它都能处理得很好。Repair 一个缺点是只能处理  flt 比 src 更“突兀”的，而LimitFilter两个方向都能处理。你既可以用它来限制类似 blurring、debanding 这类  smooth 滤镜的破坏力，也可以用它来限制 sharpening，line-darkening 这种 enhance 滤镜的副效果。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-limitfilter-与-deband\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-limitfilter-与-deband\">#</a> (2). LimitFilter 与 Deband</h3>\n<p>Dither Package当年引入这个东西，主要是为了做 Deband（去色带） 的。它是一个叫做 GradFun3  滤镜的组成部分。它们处理色带的方法是：用一个强力的，大范围的，高精度的smooth滤镜先轰一遍，把色带轰平了，然后用 LimitFilter  抢救细节。因为色带所处的平面，轰一下改变很小，很可能在给定的 thr 之内；但是线条、纹理等细节，轰一下改变就很高了，可以用  LimitFilter 来还原成 src 或者接近 src 的数值，这是当年一种做 deband 的方法。</p>\n<p>另一种，是基于上古滤镜，flash3k_yuv_deband（f3kdb）。f3kdb 没这么多花花肠子，就是找得准，然后轰。有关 Deband 的内容后续会有专门的章节，这里我们仅仅拿出一套参数来充当展示。</p>\n<p><code>dbed = core.neo_f3kdb.Deband(src,8,48,48,48,0,0,output_depth=16)</code>这是一个使用f3kdb，进行Deband的例子，具体参数的设置和含义先按下不表，我们先认为这个操作去掉了banding（色带）</p>\n<p>此时 f3kdb 可以看做一个精准的smoothing kernel，图像经过这么一整变得更加平滑，我们把它跟LimitFilter结合起来</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">dbed </span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\"> core</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">.</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">neo_f3kdb</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">.</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">Deband</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">(</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">src</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">8</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">48</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">48</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">48</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">0</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">0</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#B07D48;--shiki-dark:#BD976A\">output_depth</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">16</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">dbed </span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\"> mvf</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">.</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">LimitFilter</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">(</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">dbed</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">pre_db</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#B07D48;--shiki-dark:#BD976A\">thr</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">0.5</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#B07D48;--shiki-dark:#BD976A\">thrc</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">0.6</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">,</span><span style=\"color:#B07D48;--shiki-dark:#BD976A\">elast</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#2F798A;--shiki-dark:#4C9A91\">1.5</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">)</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>注意这里<code>thrc=0.6</code>，是chroma平面的thr。一般 Deband 的 thr×elastthr×elast 不超过2，因为大多数色带就只是1级别的差距，不会很大。而如果像 USM 那样，目的是限制线条， thr×elastthr×elast 就会给的很高，比如 3 x 4=12。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-limitfilter-融合线条与非线条\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-limitfilter-融合线条与非线条\">#</a> (3). LimitFilter 融合线条与非线条</h3>\n<p>这个需求最早是avs时代，mawen1250 写 nnedi3_resize16 的。天才mawen1250，早在 madVR 用 nnedi3  拉升之前，就设想出可以用nnedi3，这个本职为倍高的滤镜，做一个高质量的upscaler。问题是，nnedi3当时运算精度为8bit，8bit的精度处理线条部分没问题，处理平面部分就很恶心了。低精度的resize很容易在平面引入肉眼可见的色带，咋办？两条路：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>用8bit精度处理完后接一个deband；这样可行，但是，deband本身是个很复杂的操作，参数不太好给；</li>\n<li>线条部分用8bit，平面部分用16bit的常规resizer（avs时代已经有Dither_resize16做高精度resize）。反正平面部分拉升，算法好不好都没有啥区别。然后，根据线条框一个mask（区分线条平面），线条部分采取8bit高质量拉升，平面部分采取16bit高精度拉升。</li>\n</ol>\n<p>后者是旧版nnedi3_resize16的做法。这个做法是没问题的，效果也很好，就是。。。慢。最后，mawen想到了一招：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">edge </span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\"> nnedi3</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">(</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">src8</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">)</span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">.</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">to_16_bit</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">(</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">nonedge </span><span style=\"color:#999999;--shiki-dark:#666666\">=</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\"> resize16</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">(</span><span style=\"color:#393A34;--shiki-dark:#DBD7CAEE\">src16</span><span style=\"color:#2993a3;--shiki-dark:#5eaab5\">)</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>这两个clip，平面部分虽然精度有差别，但是差别非常小，也就是数值1左右的范围.如果两个clip差别在1.0以内，我认定这块是nonedge；如果差别在1.5以上，我认定这是edge。区别在这中间，不要紧，只要保证过渡连续性就好。这完全可以用LimitFilter实现：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-text\"><span class=\"line\"><span>LimitFilter(nonedge, edge, thr=1.0, elast=1.5)</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>用了这个方案后性能提升非常多。到了vs时代，滤镜内部精度都上浮点数了，这个 trick 自然没有再用的必要。但是这是在masktools之前，一个很有用的，对线条，对平面分别处理，然后巧妙的融合两者的做法：</p>\n<p><code>LimitFilter(nonedge, edge, thr=1.0~2.0, elast=1.5~2.0)</code>。</p>\n<p>事实上，deband本身可以看做，对平面做 deband（nonedge=dbed），对线条不做处理（edge=src）：<code>LimitFilter(dbed, src, thr=1.0, elast=1.5)</code>。</p>\n",

视频编码器基础</h1>\n<p>首先，编码器是一项系统工程，其中每一环都可以拿出来当一门大学课程用，也有无数的论文去给视频编码这项技术去增加技术的可能性，所以这里的编码器教学目标是让大家能听明白，知道编码器的参数是干什么的，我想要怎么做的时候去改什么参数。</p>\n<p>教程内容会涉及到不少概念，大家不需要特别深入去理解，在这个阶段会修改编码器参数，知道怎么用就行了。</p>\n<p>首先，大家一定先要弄清楚一个概念，x264 和 H264，x265 和 H265 的关系。</p>\n<p>H26x 是<strong>标准</strong>，x26x 是<strong>实现</strong>。</p>\n<p>标准定义了视频流的结构，数据流的存放等框架性内容。<br />\n实现则是你我都在用的编码器程序。</p>\n<p>任何符合 H26x 规范的编码器实现，它输出的视频流一定能够被任何符合 H26x 规范的解码器解码。</p>\n<p>所以今后请务必区分 H264，x264 等的区别，以及接下来讲的时候也别搞混了。</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-基本概念\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-基本概念\">#</a> 1. 基本概念</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-帧内编码-intra-frame-coding\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-帧内编码-intra-frame-coding\">#</a> (1). 帧内编码 (Intra-frame coding)</h3>\n<p>其实讲视频编码，实际上还是得从 I, P, B 帧说起，这三种帧是如今普及率最高的 H264 所使用的帧类型。</p>\n<p>视频编码一切的一切，基础的基础，所有东西都引用它，我们从 I 帧讲起。</p>\n<p>实际上 I 帧就是存储的一张完整的图片。</p>\n<p>由于在视频编码过程中需要对一张完整的图片进行编码。<br />\n于是乎也出现了 HEIF, AVIF 等规范，他们就是利用了 HEVC，AV1 所规定的<em>帧内编码</em>技术带来的提升，从而做到极高的压缩率。</p>\n<p>但是我们还是追根溯源，从单张图片的老祖宗说起，JPEG。</p>\n<p>JPEG 干的事情，现在的编码器对画面处理的时候全都会做。</p>\n<p>首先，***色度半采样***大家也都知道了，我们通过将 RGB 转换成 YUV，直接去掉了大量的信息。<br />\n这里的信息，是指最基础概念的，0 和 1。</p>\n<p>然后，JPEG 将图片分为了无数个 8x8 的小块。<br />\n每一块都是 64 个像素。</p>\n<p>我们对 JPEG 做了一个操作 - *<strong>DCT*</strong>：*<strong>离散余弦变换*</strong><br />\nDCT 干啥的可以不用理解，也可以理解为空间换时间的傅里叶变换，将离散的输入变到频域空间。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-07/DCT_00.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>我们通过这张表，可以将任何 8x8 的小块，通过记录每个格子用了多少次，来获得一个 8x8 的矩阵，这个矩阵能拿来重建一切 8x8 的像素。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-07/DCT_01.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>然后我们获得了一个包含一个 8x8 格子的 dct 结果。</p>\n<p>我们将结果通过除以另一个表格，这个表格叫做<em>量化表</em>。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-07/Quantization-Table.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>就能获得一个 *<strong>量化*</strong> 后的矩阵。</p>\n<p>这时候可以发现左上角有数字，右下角没有数字，因为我们通过<em>量化</em>去除了高频数据。</p>\n<p>这时候在使用<em>霍夫曼编码</em>，<em>熵编码</em>等方式，我们就能将 8x8 的一个格子变得非常小，成为简短的很小的一段数据。</p>\n<p>这就是 <em>色度半采样</em> - <em>变换</em> - <em>量化</em></p>\n<p>过程中，我们去除了高频数据，留下了低频数据。</p>\n<p>但是，所有的过程都围绕 8x8 的格子展开，当<em>量化表</em>非常激进，我们去除了大量的数据之后，每个 8x8 格子之间的差异就会被拉大。</p>\n<p>于是，我们就看到了低码率视频最常见的一种 Artifact: <strong>Blocking</strong></p>\n<p>其实如果你搞过一些 Hi-Fi 的话，纠结无损音频是不是真无损，也是看频谱图的高频有没有被保留，原理是相似的。</p>\n<p>实际上我们做的事情，就是把人对这些不是很敏感的高频数据给全抹了。<br />\n运用这项技术，再加上<em>运动侦测</em>。</p>\n<p>我们就有了最基础的，视频编码器。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-帧间编码-inter-frame-coding\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-帧间编码-inter-frame-coding\">#</a> (2). 帧间编码 (Inter-frame coding)</h3>\n<p>作为视频编码器，我们需要在时域上，寻找相似的地方，并且把这些相似的地方标记出来，去找别的帧引用。</p>\n<p>怎么分割动与静，怎么将画面细节拿出来，方案一直在进化，标准一直在提升。</p>\n<p>当初的 MPEG2，分割是最无脑的分割。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-07/MPEG2.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>也就是，纯分块。</p>\n<p>每一个最小的小方格，大小就是 8x8。</p>\n<p>这样无脑分块是无法有效寻找动态内容的。<br />\n效果较为一般，但是符合当时的算力水平。</p>\n<p>进化到 H264 时代，就多了一点点细节。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-07/H264.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>我们可以分 8x8，也可以分 4x4。<br />\n与此同时，我们还可以对每一个 16x16 的块，单独给一个 <em>qp</em>。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>QP - Quantization Parameter</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>qp</em> 是啥，量化值，还记得 JPEG 的<em>量化表</em>么？<br />\n其实就是差不多的东西。</p>\n<p>给的 <em>qp</em> 越<strong>高</strong>，被抹掉的高频信息就越多。<br />\n也意味着更可能出现视频编码的 Artifact，包括了模糊，Blocking 等。</p>\n<p>而再次进化到 H265，</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-07/H265.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>块的分割变得更加自由，最小单位也变得灵活，出现了 <code>Rect</code>，<code>Amp</code> 这样的分割</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>rect</code> - rectangular motion partitions<br />\n<code>amp</code> - asymmetric motion partitions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>（上图没有开 <code>amp</code>）</p>\n<p>详细的分块，使得寻找动和静的分割变得更容易。</p>\n<p>同时，H265 的最小变换单元变成了 <em>TU</em>，它的大小是可变的。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>TU - Transform Unit</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>也就是说，</p>\n<ol>\n<li>我们能对 4x8，8x8 等一系列大小块，动态分配 <em>qp</em>，</li>\n<li>我们能将画面分割更碎，给每个 <em>TU</em> 一个 <em>qp</em>，也意味着计算量将变得非常地可怕。</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PS: MPEG2 里，你看到的整个视频基本上所有的块都是一个qp值</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>对于 H264 来说，最大的一个格子，叫做一个<em>宏块</em> (Macroblock)，大小是定死的 16x16。</p>\n<p>而 H265 中，它可以是 16x16, 32x32, 64x64。</p>\n<p>所以，帧内编码，是所有视频编码器的<strong>底力</strong>之一，<br />\n而帧间编码，则是视频编码器的另一个<strong>底力</strong>。</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-x264-参数解析\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-x264-参数解析\">#</a> 2. x264

基础参数</h3>\n<p>打开的第一页，其实就涵盖了最简单的，<strong>预算</strong>，<strong>底力</strong>，<strong>骗力</strong>设置</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>底力</p>\n<p>什么是底力？</p>\n<p><code>--preset &lt;string&gt;</code></p>\n<p>x264 / x265 都有这样的 preset，它决定了你愿意花多大力气，去做<em>帧内编码</em>，<em>帧间搜索</em>，<em>率失真优化</em>。<br />\n当然，开的越高，边际收益也越低。</p>\n<p>尽管已经 2023 年了，<code>veryslow</code> 也已经是随便跑的参数了，但是也没人会想去开那个 <code>placebo</code>。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://dev.beandog.org/x264_preset_reference.html\">Encoding presets for x264</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>这是每个 preset 对应的，编码器底力部分设置值。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>骗力</p>\n<p>而骗力，就有些微妙了。</p>\n<p>因为有损压缩这事情，无时无刻都在追求一件事， 骗你它是无损的，你看不出。</p>\n<p>怎么把有限的预算分配在合理的区间，让你尽可能的看不出，就是骗力。</p>\n<p>但是骗力并不是全自动的，不同的视频类型需要的参数也非常不一样。</p>\n<p><code>--tune &lt;string&gt;</code></p>\n<p>尽管 x264, x265都有名曰 <code>Animation</code> 的 <em>tuning</em>，但是它是为古早制作的美漫准备的。</p>\n<p>特点就是线条少，大面积纯色，这和我们编码的日本动画差距极其巨大。</p>\n<p>所以用这样的骗力预设，可能会把所有码率预算用在不该用的地方，导致看起来非常糟糕。</p>\n<p>所以当时非常普遍使用的，是类似 <code>film</code> 这样万金油的 <em>tuning</em>。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>预算</p>\n<p>再然后，就是预算了：</p>\n<p>这告诉编码器，我有多少预算，视频可以多大</p>\n<p>这些不同模式的背后都一套复杂的算法，例如 <code>crf</code> 的目标是，给每帧分配一个固定的质量目标，每帧的 <em>qp</em> 目标都会有所不同。 它结合了人的视觉心理学，估算一个代表视频质量的指标。</p>\n<p>而下面的 <code>1pass</code> <code>2pass</code> <code>3pass</code>，</p>\n<p>则是 <code>VBR</code> ，我指定一个总的码率预算多少。</p>\n<p><code>2pass</code> 的意义是，编码器先对原视频进行一次分析， 并且根据分析给出大致的 <em>qp</em> 参考，并且在第二次的时候去详细计算。 保证我能够在总预算帽里，实现时域上的预算分配合理。</p>\n<p><code>ABR</code> 呢，额。。。总之，别用。 只有一次编码，通过经验估算下一帧大概要多少 <em>qp</em>，给一个毛估估的 <em>qp</em>。</p>\n<p>当<em>量化</em>变得不精准时，你就知道，你搞砸了。 因为，无论是 I, P, B，都记录着，<em>变换</em> - <em>量化</em>过的，<strong>块</strong></p>\n<p><strong>块</strong>是所有编码器的核心，<strong>块</strong>的好坏，很大程度上决定了视频的好坏。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>杂项</p>\n<p>而页面上的这部分，则是属于编码器的杂项部分，之一（</p>\n<p>这部分和解码相关，以前有为了兼容 psp 之类的设备特意出的版本。<br />\n当然了，2023 年了，这块可以无视了。</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>这是最笼统的介绍 x264 的参数大概能干什么， 下面我们继续深入来看。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-参数细项\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-参数细项\">#</a> (2). 参数细项</h3>\n<h4

/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GOP Size</p>\n<p>我们先来看这一段</p>\n<p>因为前面的教程讲过 GOP 的概念，这里就不深入了。</p>\n<p>其实这里只需要注意下面的 <code>Maximum GOP Size</code>。 它指的其实是 x264 命令行中的 <code>--keyint</code>， 代表多少帧之后要强制插 IDR 帧，它是一种特殊的 I 帧。 这样能保证你调戏进度条的时候，起码不会卡半天。</p>\n<p>试想如果一个视频是一个超大的 GOP，那你拖到任意一个地方，都需要从头开始解码。</p>\n<p>曾经的 b 站，有不少视频都是不能调戏进度条的，就是因为他们设置了超大的 <code>keyint</code>， 导致你拖视频进度条要卡很久或者跳到老远的地方开始播放。</p>\n<p>针对番剧，我们一般给 10 秒，也就是 240 帧， 所以就是 <code>--keyint 240</code>。</p>\n<p>但是这个 <code>240</code> 不可能不变的， 如果视频长度 11 秒，你给个 <code>240</code>，那其实也挺幽默的。</p>\n<p>所以，请根据视频长度自己给一个合适的值。</p>\n<p>而 <code>--min-keyint</code> 则是决定了两个 IDR 帧之间最小值，一般我们给 <code>1</code>。 如果图像一帧一大变，我们允许一帧一个 IDR。</p>\n<p>我们随便找个 x265 的编码最后统计结果。</p>\n<p>I 帧很贵，而 <code>keyint</code> 又不能太大也不能太小，这是我们要平衡的地方。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deblocking &amp; CABAC</p>\n<p>先看 deblocking</p>\n<p><code>-f, --deblock &lt;alpha:beta&gt;</code> 它分为两个值，它们是<em>平滑强度</em>和<em>搜索阈值</em></p>\n<p>x264 / x265 都有对应的设置，虽然在我们 bdrip 的时候，几乎不会出现 blocking，<br

上下。</p>\n<p><code>Adaptive B-Frames</code> 对应了 <code>--b-adapt</code>。<br />\n是设立 B 帧算法，值为 <code>0</code>（不设 B 帧），<code>1</code>，<code>2</code>。<br />\n数字越大算法越慢效果越好，<br />\n所以我们就开 <code>2</code>（</p>\n<p><code>B-Pyramid</code> 是一种给左右参考的 B 帧，<br />\n实际上是特殊的 B 帧，它能够帮助我们实现更长的 B 帧，所以一般也得开。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other</p>\n<p>再看这里，涉及到了<em>动态搜索</em>时，参考的帧的数量。</p>\n<p>这玩意儿其实也决定了 H264

/>\n还记得最开始说的么，如果你给个超夸张量化，满屏幕全是块，码率当然会低。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Quantizers</p>\n<p>量化部分就决定了怎么取量化，</p>\n<p><code>Min/Max/Delta</code>，分别决定了整个视频 <em>qp</em> 的最低/最高/帧间 <em>qp</em> 最大插值。<br />\n如果我们给的比较高 <code>crf</code>，又怕出现真烂帧，会考虑压低 <code>--qpmax</code>。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>对应 <code>--qpmin</code> / <code>--qpmax</code> / <code>--qpstep</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>下面的 <code>ratio</code>，分别是 <code>--ipratio</code> 和 <code>--pbratio</code>，<br />\n他们代表了，P 帧对 I 帧，B 帧对 P 帧，<em>qp</em> 值的变化。<br />\n因为有帧间块引用的存在，所以我们可以给 B 和 P 帧整体一个较高的 <em>qp</em> 目标，也不影响整体画面。<br />\n但是，如果出现了连续的 B 帧，B 帧又自己引用自己，<br />\n同时被引用的 B 帧 <em>qp</em> 值也很高的话，连续 B 帧就会出现肉眼可见的劣化。<br />\n而动画特性又决定了连续 B 帧机会非常多，<br />\n所以做动画相关的内容时，我们会压低这个比例，高质量编码会给 <code>pbratio</code> <code>1.2</code>，<code>ipratio</code> <code>1.3</code>。<br />\n顺带默认 <code>ipratio</code> 是 <code>1.4</code>, <code>pbratio</code> 是 <code>1.3</code>。</p>\n<p><code>Chroma QP Offset</code> 就比较有意思，这个值代表 UV 平面相对 Y 平面，<em>qp</em> 值的 offset。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>对应 <code>--chroma-qp-offset</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>本来 UV 就已经被大砍一刀（指色度采样），你还给加把火不太合适。<br />\n当然，如果你在编码 YUV444 的视频源的时候，你大可以给个 <code>2</code>-<code>4</code>。<br />\n420 就算了，x265 也有类似的设置，我们一般都给 <code>-2</code>。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rate-Control</p>\n<p><code>VBV</code> 两个码率，是用来限制最高码率的。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>对应 <code>--vbv-maxrate</code> <code>--vbv-bufsize</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>如果你压的动画有大量屑特效，<br />\n类似高密度头皮屑噪点，里氏 9 级地震级别镜头摇晃，<br />\n如果你不加限制，这些屑场景能轻松吃掉你码率预算的非常大一块。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>比如一部叫后街女孩的屑番（</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>这些场景，大可不必追求 “暂停画质”，给个上限非常有必要，<br />\n毕竟你也看不清。<br />\n当然，如果给的太低，出现超长噪点回忆杀，再叠加 B 帧连续参考劣化，<br />\n大家看视频都见过画面一开始还行越放越烂， 就是因为连续参考还超高 <em>qp</em>。<br />\n所以还是慎重，看情况行事。</p>\n<p>而 <code>VBV Initial Buffer</code> 就不用动。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>对应 <code>--vbv-init</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>Quantizer Compression</code> 则是又一个很重要的东西，但是解释清楚也需要重达几公斤的参考资料。<br />\n简单来说，通过一系列迭代算法形成一个 <em>qp</em> 值的曲线缩放，<code>--qcomp</code> 给的越高，x264 越倾向于 <em>qp</em> 选择一视同仁，无论动静一律给差不多的 <em>qp</em> 值。<br />\n但是人眼，在大自然进化的过程中，天生就对动态的东西极为敏感，<br />\n静态的东西只要他不动，基本就当看不见。</p>\n<p><code>qcomp</code> 越低，x264 会给高动态场景越高的 <em>qp</em> 值，让动态画面烂完。<br />\n这个值的取值，任然是看你，默认给的 <code>0.6</code>。<br />\n如果做什么打斗多的番，<br />\n可能还是给高一点，战斗场景不容易烂。<br />\n反过来日常废萌番给个默认值完全够了。<br />\n当然就是，你觉得重要那就多给点咯，<code>0.7</code>，<code>0.75</code> 都是可以给的。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MB-tree</p>\n<p>又到了x264的重头戏环节，<code>MB Tree</code>。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>关掉的话对应 <code>--no-mbtree</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>x264 的块，叫做 <em>MacroBlock</em>，<br />\n在一个时间范围内，会有不同的帧可以被引用到某个块上，<br />\n也有可能是块引用块，<br />\n数据结构上就变成了一棵树。</p>\n<p>为了防止反复参考导致的问题，树越靠上的节点可以让 <code>qp</code> 值稍微低一些，<br />\n上梁正了下梁不太可能歪，<code>qp</code> 值就可以给高一些。<br />\n块被参考的越多，那它的<code>qp</code>就越低。</p>\n<p>当然这是 <em>MB tree</em> 最笼统的解释。<br />\n反映了好钢用在刀刃的思想，被引用的越多，那本体质量越高引用的质量就越高。</p>\n<p>但是，好钢容易生锈，在低 <code>crf</code> 下，大家的质量都很高了，这时候你去开这个，反而会导致画面问题。</p>\n<p>在 <code>crf 16</code> 朝上，<code>mbtree</code> 效果就不错，因为码率这时候还是比较吃紧的。<br />\n总之如果码率预算非常高，我们就不需要它。</p>\n<p>当然，现在 x264 的使用基本就是字幕组的内嵌了，<br />\n内封外挂也已经使用 hevc。<br />\n可能不会遇到真的需要 x264 做编码的情况。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>lookahead</p>\n<p>这个则是 <code>--rc-lookahead</code>，一般来说是编码往前看多少帧，来查未来开销。<br />\n这是判断 <code>vbv</code>, <code>MB Tree</code>, IBP 帧的参数。</p>\n<p>不能低，但是开太高也没啥用。<br />\n一般给 <code>80</code> 到 <code>0.5*keyint</code> 左右。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adaptive Quantizers</p>\n<p>这是一个很重要的参数。</p>\n<p><code>aq</code> 是防止平面过度量化的功能，用被量化程度去进行 <em>qp</em> 值的补偿，上面的 <code>mode</code> 中我们有 <code>0</code>-<code>3</code> 四个选项可选，其中 <code>0</code> 为关闭，<code>1</code> 为平面内的简单分配，<code>2</code> 为进行<em>帧间 aq-variance</em> 计算，允许跨帧进行调整，一般我们用的最多的就是 <code>3</code>，针对暗场做优化，因为人眼对暗场的敏感度比亮场高很多，同时色块和色带也常出现于暗场，低码率下尤为明显。</p>\n<p>所以一般都会给经典的 <code>--aq-mode 3</code> <code>--aq-strength 0.7</code>。<br />\n如果整体画面码率充足，<code>crf</code> 开的很低（<code>15</code> 以下），给 <code>--aq-mode 1</code>，<code>--aq-strength 0.8</code> 也是不错的选择。</p>\n<p><code>--aq-mode 2</code> 会强调动态和高频部分，平面码率会被削（整体视频码率也就低了），开了很容易平面上出瑕疵，所以如果想开，最好喂视频之前就把平面抹抹干净，并且给 <code>0.9</code> 及以上的

目前提供了两个滤镜：<code>LibavSMASHSource</code> 和 <code>LWLibavSource</code>。最常用的是 <code>LWLibavSource</code>，支持各种类型的输入，在第一次读取时会生成 <code>lwi</code> 文件。其次是 <code>LibavSMASHSource</code>，只支持 mp4 输入，但不需要生成

参数可以将源转为指定的帧率而保持视频长度不变，在输入源帧率与目标不匹配时，会进行抽帧和插入重复帧。这在处理一些帧率混乱的源，比如来路不明的 web 流媒体源时可能有用，当然前提是视频平均帧率和目标帧率相差不大。<code>repeat</code> 用于交错源，将在后续章节中介绍。<code>prefer_hw</code>

IDR，可以从这帧开始独立解码。<code>Pic</code> 表示帧类型，1 代表 I 帧，2 代表 P 帧，3 代表 B 帧。 根据 lwi 的帧信息我们可以判断 GOP，从一个 KEY=1 的 IDR（含）到下一个 KEY=1 的 IDR（不含）就为一个 GOP。</p>\n<p>严格来说 KEY=1 表示 RAP（random access point），比 IDR 更进一步，表示可以从这帧开始完全重新解码。IDR  表示后续的帧不会再依赖前面的帧，但是并不保证不需要前面的数据。实际解码中，除了帧数据还有一些全局或半全局的参数，学名 VPS（video  parameter set）和 SPS（sequence parameter set），它们为编码器提供一些必要的设置参数。lwi 的  key=1 说的是包括了 SPS 的 IDR 帧，因此可能发现有些 IDR 帧是 Key=0。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-ffms2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-ffms2\">#</a> (2). ffms2</h3>\n<p>ffms2 全称 FFmpeg Source 2，是另一个广泛使用的源滤镜。<a

<code>res1</code> 和 <code>res2</code> 则发现最后呈现结果区别很小。因此，拉伸 UV 平面基本没必要选用特别锐利的滤镜，区别实在不是很明显。</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

id=\"2-图像的缩放\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-图像的缩放\">#</a> (2). 图像的缩放</h3>\n<p>通常人们会认为数字图像是由一堆相同大小的正方形像素块组成，这种观念实际上是错误的。实际上，我们应该把图像看做一块连续的平面，而像素是其上没有大小只有坐标的采样点。只要采样的数量足够多，那我们就可以用这些分立的点表示整幅图像。</p>\n<p>缩放图像，则应该理解为图像平面本身没有变化，而只是增加或减少采样点数量，或者说密度。</p>\n<p>以下面这幅图像为例，现在有 4 个像素，坐标分别是：<code>(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)</code>。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-06/image06.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>现在我们希望将图像的宽高都放大两倍，最终有 16 个像素。按照中心对齐，现在这些像素的位置如下图红点所示。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-06/image07.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>可以发现这些新像素在原来坐标系下处于小数坐标的位置，而这些位置是没有准确值的，因此我们只能通过周围已知像素，猜测这些位置的值，这被称为插值（interpolation）。</p>\n<p>插值有两个关键点，一是 <code>taps</code>，即选取周围多大范围的已知像素；二是 <code>weight</code>，即这些选中的像素的权重是多少。</p>\n<p><code>taps</code> 很好理解，就是选取范围的半径，选取的周围像素越多，“猜测”就越可能准确。但同时，涉及的像素越多，计算也就越慢。</p>\n<p><code>weight</code> 也容易理解，比如图上 <code>(1,0)</code> 和 <code>(1,1)</code> 位置的像素到 <code>(0.25, 1.25)</code> 采样点的距离不同，它们所占的比重自然也是不一样的。</p>\n<p>在实际中，我们使用 <code>kernel</code> 来描述以上性质。kernel 是一个曲线，它的横坐标表示已知像素到采样点的距离，纵坐标表示在这个距离上，该像素贡献的权值。taps 也在曲线上有所表现，超过 taps 范围的像素没有贡献，因此曲线恒为 0。</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amusementclub.github.io/ResampleHQ/kernels.html\">https://amusementclub.github.io/ResampleHQ/kernels.html</a></p>\n<p>可以通过这个网页查看各种 kernel 的形状，将鼠标移到曲线下方的 kernel 名字上可以显示对应的 kernel 曲线，同时也可以在最下方的直方图上看到各个  kernel 对应的 blurring、sharpness、ringing 三种性质。不过需要注意的是，这里讲的 kernel  性质是数学上的定义，和我们前面讲的视觉上的概念还有些区别。</p>\n<p>最后，我们通过这张图来形象地说明 2 维图片的插值过程。<br />\n如图所示，先是在横向上进行插值，算出中间点，然后纵向上再利用这些中间点，进一步插值算出目标点。<br />\n这一过程体现出，横向和纵向的插值是完全独立的，事实上，我们甚至可以在两个方向使用完全不同的算法。<br />\n另外，这幅图也展示了，不同 taps 的插值算法会利用到的周围像素范围。</p>\n<p>![img](<a

<code>nearest</code>，最常见的算法之一，它可以说没有插值，只是单纯采样最近的像素。这里没有提供它的 kernel 曲线，但根据性质描述应该不难画出。由于它只采样最近的像素，显然是 <code>1-taps</code> 的。</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

VS简介</h2>\n<p>VapourSynth，简称 VS，官网是 <a href=\"https://www.vapoursynth.com\">https://www.vapoursynth.com</a>。你可以在 <a href=\"https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/releases\">Github</a> 上下载最新版本，包括安装版和便携版。</p>\n<p>VCB-Studio 目前使用的 VS 则是娱乐部版，全称 VapourSynth-Classic，简称 VS-C。你可以在<a href=\"https://github.com/AmusementClub/vapoursynth-classic/releases\">这里</a>下载最新版。</p>\n<p>VS-C 源于 VS 社区的一次重大分裂。VS 项目开发者在 R55 引入了全新的 API4，这导致了严重的兼容性问题：API4 的 VS  虽然能够同时支持新的 API4 滤镜和旧的 API3 滤镜，但却不支持 API3 脚本。而这些多年传承的脚本才是 VS  发展的精髓，这对于追求稳定生产环境的 VCB-S 来说是不可接受的。</p>\n<p>另一方面，VS 开发者在 API4 还引入了大量破坏性弃用，以迫使用户和滤镜开发者转向 API4。同时还采取先进的 user driven testing，让普通用户积极参与到新版的验证与反馈工作中。</p>\n<p>基于以上复杂情况，总监 Akarin 创立了 VS-C，同时兼容 API3 与 API4 脚本，全力保证生产环境的向后兼容性。此外 VS-C 兼具前后两代 VS 之长，既有 API4 的低内存开销，又有 API3 的高处理速度。</p>\n<p>有了 VS 本体，问题还没有完全解决。上述这些 VS 本体只含有少量的内置滤镜，这显然是远远不够的。收集滤镜和常用工具脚本是一件复杂繁琐的事，这里我们提供了一套打包好的便携版 VS-C，含有大部分常用滤镜和脚本：<a href=\"https://github.com/AmusementClub/tools/releases%E3%80%82\">https://github.com/AmusementClub/tools/releases。</a></p>\n<p>打开 VS 目录，我们可以看到 VS 本体的一堆 dll 和 python 环境。VS 本体和滤镜都是由 C++ 编写，而它暴露给用户的接口则是  python 的。我们可以通过 python 编写 VS 脚本，然后通过 VSPipe 运行脚本获得输出。你可以认为 VS 是 python  的一个库，也可以认为 VS 使用 python 做 dsl (domain specific language) 或者更通俗地讲就是  glue（把滤镜给串联起来）。</p>\n<p><code>vapoursynth64</code> 目录下是 VS 滤镜，<code>coreplugins</code> 是内置滤镜，<code>plugins</code> 是第三方滤镜。对于我们提供的 VS-C 包，AI 滤镜相关的模型和运行环境等也放在 <code>plugins</code> 目录。</p>\n<p>同时，我们提供的包里的 python 还内置了 pip，可以方便地安装额外包。</p>\n<p>将这一整套内容打包为便携包不是一件容易的事，事实上在上古时期，VS 基本都是通过安装来使用，这带来了严重的版本管理问题。</p>\n<p>目前我们使用总监 SaltyChiang 开发的打包工具 <a href=\"https://github.com/AmusementClub/VapourSynth-Portable-Maker\">VapourSynth-Portable-Maker</a> 来完成打包工作，对打包有兴趣的同学可以看看。</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-vs预览\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-vs预览\">#</a> 2. VS预览</h2>\n<p>有了 VSPipe，其实我们就已经可以运行脚本输出处理结果，但我们更希望可以实时修改脚本并看到滤镜的效果，这就需要一个预览器。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-vapoursynth-editor\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-vapoursynth-editor\">#</a> (1). VapourSynth-Editor</h3>\n<p>预览器在很长时间里只有一个，<code>VapourSynth-Editor</code>（简称 vsedit 或 vse），<a href=\"https://github.com/AmusementClub/VapourSynth-Editor%E3%80%82vse\">https://github.com/AmusementClub/VapourSynth-Editor。vse</a> 是一个 IDE，可以在里面编写 VS 脚本，并进行预览、测试、调试等。它提供了少量的高光和代码补完功能，但不是很完善，只对滤镜起作用，对脚本函数则没有作用。vse 也没有提供代码的查找与替换功能，使用起来不太方便。</p>\n<p>vse 需要依赖 VS 运行，而且原版 vse 优先选择注册表中的 VS 而不是用户指定的 VS，当系统中有多个 VS，或者曾经使用过安装版  VS，那你几乎永远无法知道它使用的是哪个 VS。当然目前娱乐部版已经修复了这个问题，它会优先找同目录的 VS，即开即用。</p>\n<p>一般来说，VS 脚本文件都是 python 脚本，为了区分，我们用 <code>vpy</code> 作为后缀名。</p>\n<p>这里有一个简单预览脚本：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

<code>havsfunc</code>（Holy 从 AVS 移植的工具合集），并分别指定别名为 <code>mvf</code> 和 <code>haf</code>，这是日常做番最常用到的工具。</p>\n<p>再看后三句，这里细节很多，我们一个一个分析。</p>\n<p>首先 <code>a = &quot;00010.m2ts&quot;</code>，这是指定视频源文件的路径。<br />\n一般写脚本的时候要避免这种单个字母的无脑命名。 但本组约定俗成采用 a 代指输入文件，注意在这之后的 OKE 中会用到。</p>\n<p>这里使用的是相对路径，需要保证 00010.m2ts 和 vpy 脚本在同一目录下。 如果要使用绝对路径，可以这样：<code>a = R&quot;E:\\Anime\\00010.m2ts&quot;</code>。 这里被 R 引号圈起来的是一个 Raw String，所见即所得，可以避免复杂的转义问题。 不然你就得写：<code>&quot;E:\\\\Anime\\\\00010.m2ts&quot;</code>。</p>\n<p>第二句 <code>src8 = core.lsmas.LWLibavSource(a)</code>，这是使用源滤镜 <code>lsmas</code> 载入视频，获取一个在 vs 里称为 clip 的变量，并命名为 <code>src8</code>。<br />\n除了文件名之外的变量，一般需要有一定意义，方便解读。 通常我们用 <code>src</code> 指代源，8 表示精度，原盘一般都是 8-bit。 而最后的输出结果，则用 <code>res</code> 指代。</p>\n<p>从这一行我们也能看出 vs 滤镜的使用规律，是 <code>core.&lt;package_name&gt;.&lt;filter_name&gt;(...)</code> 的形式。<br />\n这里 lsmas 就是 package_name，而 LWLibavSource 就是 filter_name。<br />\n脚本函数（比如上面提到的 mvf 和 haf）的使用则有些不同，是 <code>&lt;package_name&gt;.&lt;function_name&gt;(...)</code> 的形式，这一点我们会在后面看到。</p>\n<p>最后，使用 <code>set_output()</code> 将读入的视频输出。</p>\n<p>现在我们尝试使用 vsedit 来运行脚本。</p>\n<p>如果你的滤镜载入正确，vsedit 应该可以高亮显示滤镜名称。 在上方工具栏选择 <code>Script - Check script</code>，或者按 <code>F6</code>，就可以检查脚本是否能正常输出。 如果是第一次读取某个视频文件，LWLibavSource 会生成一个后缀为 <code>lwi</code> 的索引文件，便于以后再次读取视频。 源文件越大，需要的时间越多，对于好几个 GB 的蓝光原盘需要等待几分钟。SSD

/>\n帧率 24000/1001=23.976，这个数字要牢记，这是日本动画的典型帧率。<br />\n最后像素格式 YUV420P8，说明这是 YUV 色彩空间，420 下采样，数据位深为 8-bit。</p>\n<p>检查完了这些，就可以用 <code>Script - Preview</code>，或者按 <code>F5</code> 来预览实际画面。</p>\n<p>它会打开一个预览窗口，其中包含许多方便的功能。<br />\n上方窗口可以拖动浏览整个画面，键盘上的前后键可以调整到上一帧或者下一帧。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-05/image03.png\" alt=\"img\"

/>\nNearest 是完全没有运算，只是单纯复制粘贴的缩放方法，将原来的 1 个像素变成 4 个，9 个，16 个...<br />\n注意不要用 Nearest 进行缩小或者非整数倍的放大，锯齿非常恐怖。<br />\nBilinear 是使用插值进行缩放，它是最简单的线性插值，所以一般也不会引入额外的副作用。我们通常都用 Nearest 放大进行观察，除了观察锯齿的时候，可能会用 Bilinear。</p>\n<p>前面取色的时候我们看到，输出的 YUV 实际被渲染为 RGB 呈现，这是 vsedit 自动帮我们做了。但是 vsedit 做的精度不佳，所以我们通常在脚本里手动转为 RGB 进行预览。</p>\n<p>我们把脚本改为：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

VapourSynth-Preview</h3>\n<p><code>VapourSynth-Preview</code>（简称 vspreview 或 vsp）是近两年兴起的另一个预览器，区别于 vsedit 的独立程序，vsp 是由 python 编写的模块，因此可以直接集成到 python 环境中。</p>\n<p>vsp 的初始 repo 已经不再维护，因此目前版本繁多。我们使用的娱乐部版（也是 portable 包中集成的版本）：<a

id=\"vscode\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#vscode\">#</a> VSCode</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>安装 <code>VSCode</code>，并在扩展商店里安装 <code>Python</code> 和 <code>Pylance</code> 扩展。</li>\n<li>将本章 <code>.vscode</code> 目录的文件复制到 VSCode 用户配置目录 <code>%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\</code>。如果用户配置目录已经有同名文件，不要覆盖，将相应内容复制到原有文件中。</li>\n<li>修改 <code>settings.json</code> 中的 python 路径，改为你的 VapourSynth 对应的 python 路径。</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"vapoursynth\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#vapoursynth\">#</a> VapourSynth</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>安装 VapourSynth-Preview。可参考上述 repo 的说明，如果使用我们的 portable 包则不必再安装。</li>\n<li>安装 <a href=\"https://github.com/SaltyChiang/VapourSynth-Plugins-Stub-Generator/tree/R57Classic\">VapourSynth-Plugins-Stub-Generator</a>。这是由总监 SaltyChiang 开发的小工具，用于在 VSCode 里支持代码补全。同样，portable 包中已经集成，不必再安装。 如果首次安装，运行 <code>python -m vsstubs install</code>，如果使用 portable 包，运行 <code>python -m vsstubs update</code>。注意以后每次增加滤镜都需要重新 update。</li>\n</ol>\n<p>以上，我们就配置好了全部所需内容。现在使用 VSCode 打开 vpy 脚本（或者所在文件夹），如果配置成功，可以看到脚本高亮和语法补全信息。接下来可以使用 <code>Ctrl+F6/Ctrl+F5</code> 进行类似 vsedit 的 F6/F5 的脚本检查/预览。不过这里的脚本检查只检查是否正常运行，不提供 vsedit 那样的 clip 信息。</p>\n<p>我们的配置还提供了额外两个功能：<code>Ctrl+F7</code>，相当于 vs info，打印输出 clip 的信息；<code>Ctrl+F8</code>，相当于 vs benchmark，计算输出 clip 的所有帧，可以测试脚本速度。</p>\n<p>vsp 的基本功能与 vsedit 差别不大，但更加易于使用。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-05/image05.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>左下角，最底下一栏显示 clip 信息，与 vsedit 类似，这里多了一个帧类型信息，可以看到这一帧为 P 帧。<br />\n上面一栏，从左开始，<code>output</code> 按钮选择输出节点，后面 <code>sync outputs</code> 选择是否在节点间同步，这个功能我们后面再说。<br />\n第二个按钮指定帧号，第三个指定时间戳，后面 100% 的按钮选择缩放倍率，vsp 里默认是 Nearest 算法。最后 <code>Timeline</code> 可以切换时间轴按时间戳显示还是按帧号显示。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"

创建一组标记，然后可以在下方一栏添加标记。<br />\n<code>AB</code> 直接标记当前帧，并添加到 List。<code>A</code> 将当前帧标记为起点，<code>B</code> 将当前帧标记为终点，A、B 联合使用可以标记一段区间，然后点 <code>Add to List</code> 加入到 List 中。</p>\n<p>最右边的按钮可以导出当前 List 的所有标记，可以手动调整导出格式，导出后存放在剪切板里，找个地方粘贴即可。</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pipette</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-05/image09.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>这个功能相当于 vsedit 的取色器，鼠标移到画面上可以在左下角显示像素的 YUV 值以及渲染后的 RGB 值。</p>\n<p>从左到右依次为：坐标 <code>(x, y)</code>，渲染后 RGB 值，输出 clip 原始像素值。<br />\n视频里的坐标轴以左上角为原点，横向向右为 x 轴正向，竖向向下为 y 轴正向。<br />\n原始和渲染后的像素都有 3 组表示，第一组是 16 进制的量化值，第二组是 10 进制的量化值，第三组是浮点值。</p>\n<p>vsp 采用 vs 滤镜来渲染输出 clip，不像 vse 那样有较大精度问题，因此一般可以直接 set_output 输出，不用转为 RGB。</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Benchmark</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-05/image10.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>就是跑测试输出，与之前说的 Ctrl+F8 快捷键相比，可以更精确地指定输出的帧数范围。</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Misc</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-05/image11.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p><code>Reload Script</code> 如果你更改了脚本，可以按这个重新加载。<br />\n<code>Save</code> 导出 vsp 设置，比如前面提到的部分选项，它可以记忆下来，下次打开直接启用。当然一般不需要这个功能，因为 vsp 会自动保存到脚本所在目录的 <code>.vspreview</code> 目录下。<br />\n<code>Copy Frame</code> / <code>Save Frame as</code> 可以复制/保存当前帧截图，右边可以设置导出文件名。</p>\n<p>好了，经典版 vsp 的功能就讲这么多，其中一些功能有快捷键：<a

画面要素</h2>\n<p>在介绍画质瑕疵之前，我们首先来简单介绍基本的画面要素。这有助于我们把握画面的重点，有针对性地去寻找瑕疵。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-空间上的频率划分平面纹理和线条\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-空间上的频率划分平面纹理和线条\">#</a> (1). 空间上的频率划分：平面，纹理和线条</h3>\n<p>在视频处理中，空间(spatial)的概念指的是一帧图片以内的像素变化。从频率的角度看，任何画面区域都是多种复杂频率的混合体，但其不同区域的各种频率所占比重有明显区别。</p>\n<p>像素变化较快，变动幅度大的区域，高频分量占据主导地位。像素变化缓慢，变化幅度小的区域，低频分量占据主导地位。</p>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-04/image01\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-04/image01</a> spatial.png)</p>\n<h4 id=\"平面\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#平面\">#</a> 平面</h4>\n<p>平面(flat areas)是包含大量低频分量的区域，其特点是像素变化非常小。如上图左侧黄框区域。</p>\n<h4 id=\"线条\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#线条\">#</a> 线条</h4>\n<p>线条(lines)是包含极端高频分量的区域，其像素有跳跃式的急剧变化。如上图中间红框区域。</p>\n<h4 id=\"纹理\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#纹理\">#</a> 纹理</h4>\n<p>纹理(texture)区域较为复杂，其像素在小范围内频繁变化，高低起伏不断。纹理变化剧烈的，称之为强纹理，中高频成分占据主导，其性质接近于线条。如上图左侧蓝框区域。纹理变化平缓的，称之为弱纹理，中低频率成分占据主导，其性质接近于平面。如上图右侧绿框区域。</p>\n<h4 id=\"噪点\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#噪点\">#</a> 噪点</h4>\n<p>噪点(noise)是一类特殊的画面要素，表现为随机的像素涨落，它可以叠加到以上任意要素中。噪点的频率构成取决于其种类，白噪声在各个频率的强度完全一致，而一般动画原盘所带的噪点则涵盖低频到中高频，随频率增高而略有下降，最高频部分则基本被砍掉。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-时间上的频率划分静态和动态\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-时间上的频率划分静态和动态\">#</a> (2). 时间上的频率划分：静态和动态</h3>\n<p>在视频处理中，时间(temporal)的概念指的是帧与帧之间的像素变化。</p>\n<p>一段视频如果变化剧烈，其时间复杂度较高，时域上的高频信息占比就较多。而如果视频本身变化缓慢，多为静态，其时间复杂度较低，时域上的低频信息占比就较多。</p>\n<p>一般来说，一段视频的时域高频信息多，动态的信息量就大，所需要记录的数据量就越多，编码所需要的运算量也越大。这就是为什么动态高的部分更容易发生欠码。但是另一方面，人眼对高速变化的场景，敏感度不如静态的图片来的高，因为没有时间去仔细观察细节。所以动态场景的优先度可以低于静态场景，高动态镜头的帧稍微烂一点是可以接受的。如何权衡以上两点去分配码率，是实际编码中需要考虑的重点。</p>\n<h2

banding)</h3>\n<p>色带是最常见的瑕疵，没有之一。色带产生的本质原因是量化数据的精度不足。目前绝大部分的片源采用 YUV 8bit 编码，然而在 YUV 模型下 8bit  的数据精度范围，不足以达到人眼可分辨精度的极限，这就导致色彩出现可分辨的断层，即色带。另一方面，早期的大部分制作商并没有考虑如何在有限的精度范围内使用额外的手段避免色带，这就导致了色带泛滥成灾。如今这一现象有所改善，部分制作商已经意识到这一问题，并通过加入噪点和抖动的方式来避免色带。</p>\n<p>色带在暗场平面以及渐变颜色的场景最容易观测到。色带通常表现为一系列波浪状、同心环状的阶梯区域。</p>\n<p>色带的处理方式叫做去色带 (deband / de-banding)。</p>\n<p>注意下图中间的头发平面区域。</p>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-04/image02\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-04/image02</a>

(aliasing)</h3>\n<p>锯齿是最典型、最常见的线条瑕疵。锯齿表现为原本应该连续的线条上，发生了线条与平面的交替、毛刺、或者断线。锯齿的类型很多，不同类型的锯齿有不同的产生原因。</p>\n<p>锯齿的处理方式叫做抗锯齿 (anti-aliasing / aa)。</p>\n<h4 id=\"二值化锯齿\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#二值化锯齿\">#</a> 二值化锯齿</h4>\n<p>二值化锯齿是动画制作的二值化过程产生的。对于手绘作画的动画，原画首先被扫描得到二值化的数字图片，之后进行润线来平滑线条。如果扫描性能太差或者润线做得不到位，就会留下凹凸不平的线条。</p>\n<p>注意梗小姐右下角的头发。</p>\n<p>![img](<a

10bit 压制下，对于保护型噪点的需求有所降低，可以削去一部分来降低码率。而画风型噪点是组成画面的重要部分，很大程度影响着最终的还原度，需要尽量保留。</p>\n<p>另外视觉心理学优化也应当纳入考量。对于人眼来说，亮场区域的噪点几乎不可见，可以尽量削去。色度噪点对画风的影响基本是恼人的，应该尽可能去掉。</p>\n<p>![img](<a

href=\"#14-色度偏移-chroma-shift\">#</a> (14). 色度偏移 (chroma shift)</h3>\n<p>色度偏移，指的是色度平面相对亮度平面的错位。其目视效果通常是，在极红、极蓝等（UV 值极大或极小）平面与线条的交界处，多了一些重影。或者说线条一侧的颜色侵入到另一侧。</p>\n<p>色度偏移通常是由于不正确的 chroma placement (chroma 平面相对 luma 平面的偏移) 处理而导致的。实际中色度偏移通常只有 0.5 个像素，最多 1 个像素，效果非常不明显，一般人很难观察到。</p>\n<p>色度偏移的处理方式叫做 fix chroma shift。</p>\n<p>下图为手动制作的向左偏移 3 个像素的例子，注意图中头发线条部分，颜色发生了严重的错位。</p>\n<p>![img](<a

各平面间不存在类似 YUV 那样的偏移，因此 RGB shift 几乎一定是故意制作的特效，并不是一种瑕疵。</p>\n<p>区分 RGB shift 与 chroma shift 最好的方式，一是看是否是单侧偏移，chroma shift  只可能是单侧偏移；二是看白色平面上的黑色线条，由于白色和黑色在 YUV 下的 UV 相同，其分界面不可能产生 chroma  shift，只可能产生 RGB shift。</p>\n<p>![img](<a href=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-04/image23\">https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-04/image23</a> RGB shift.png)</p>\n<h3

chroma 平面的线条宽度远大于 luma 平面线条宽度，导致侵蚀了周围的颜色。</p>\n<p>色度溢出的处理方式一般是对 chroma 平面进行收线，将线条控制到与 luma 平面相同，记作 fix chroma bleeding。</p>\n<p>色度溢出的范围一般较小，不易观察，下图实际为特效。</p>\n<p>![img](<a

或者裸视频流 h264，一般抽取为 h264 即可。实际上，一般我们不需要提取视频轨，因为大多数工具可以直接从 m2ts 文件中获取视频。</p>\n<h4 id=\"音轨的抽取\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#音轨的抽取\">#</a> 音轨的抽取</h4>\n<p>原盘的音轨有 PCM / TrueHD / DTS-HD MA 等无损格式，也有 AC3 / DTS 等有损格式。按照 VCB-Studio 规范，对于无损音轨，提取为 flac 格式；对于有损音轨，提取为原本格式。</p>\n<p>需要注意一点，TrueHD / DTS-HD MA 音轨往往存在一个内嵌的 AC3 / DTS core 有损音轨，这是为了给不兼容 TrueHD / DTS-HD MA 的设备提供向下兼容。这导致很多时候 MediaInfo 只认出一条音轨，而播放器会认出两条。对于这种情况，直接丢弃有损部分即可。</p>\n<h4 id=\"字幕的抽取\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#字幕的抽取\">#</a> 字幕的抽取</h4>\n<p>原盘有时会有 PGS 图形字幕，抽取为 sup 即可。</p>\n<p>需要注意的是，不能使用 ffmpeg 进行抽流。因为 eac3to 会做一些额外的，但是非常有用的检查。</p>\n<p>比如它会检查音轨的真正 bitdepth。有些原盘标注的是 24bit PCM，但是实际的有效精度只有 16bit。这时 eac3to 会抽取为 16bit。</p>\n<p>还比如有些原盘的音轨有延迟（delay），但是部分播放器对 delay 的支持不是很好，为了避免播放出现问题，VCB-Studio 规范要求消去 delay。eac3to 会自动检查 delay，并重新调整为无 delay。</p>\n<h4 id=\"eac3to的命令行操作\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#eac3to的命令行操作\">#</a> eac3to的命令行操作</h4>\n<p>最后补充一下 eac3to 的命令行用法，命令行会有一些更灵活的用法。</p>\n<p>可以使用这个命令查看 m2ts

m2ts 吗，我们当时说它们是菜单的按钮或者动画，这里就来教大家如何提取这些内容。</p>\n<p>我们使用的是这个工具：<a href=\"https://github.com/SAPikachu/igstools%E3%80%82\">https://github.com/SAPikachu/igstools。</a></p>\n<p>这个工具依赖于 python，安装稍微有点麻烦。需要注意的是，它的 readme 很久没更新了，落后于实际功能。</p>\n<p>这里以 portable 版 python 为例，介绍如何安装并使用 igstools，对于安装版的 python  也是类似的。如果你已经下载了本章开头提到的工具包，请找到 OKEGui\\tools\\vapoursynth\\python.exe  的路径；如果你还没有下载工具包，还等什么，赶紧回到本章开头去下载吧。</p>\n<p>通过以下命令安装 igstools：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-text\"><span class=\"line\"><span>\"path\\\\to\\\\python.exe\" -m pip install pypng</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span>\"path\\\\to\\\\python.exe\" -m pip install https://github.com/SAPikachu/igstools/archive/master.zip</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>安装好以后，通过以下命令拆包 m2ts：</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-text\"><span class=\"line\"><span>\"path\\\\to\\\\python.exe\" -m igstools \"path\\\\to\\\\xxxxx.m2ts\"</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>拆包成功的话，会在 m2ts 目录下看到一堆 png 图片。通过这些图片可以获取到原盘菜单播放时的一些信息，比如有哪些特典、正片的章节名等等。这样你可以了解原盘的内容，不至于遗漏一些特典，以及可以根据章节名补充完整章节信息。</p>\n<p>一些压制组比如 ANK-Raws 会选择将拆包出的图片打包作为特典附带。而按照 VCB-Studio 规范，菜单按钮的处理完全属于可选内容，直接忽略不管也没有问题。</p>\n<p>原盘中的 Menu 以及其按钮一般有两种情况，Menu 中有文字，按钮提供文字特效、动画效果、以及额外的弹出文字窗口；Menu 中只有背景，其他内容全在按钮中。对于第一种情况，我们建议直接忽略按钮；对于第二种情况，可以选择性地处理。</p>\n<p>如果是一图式的 Menu，可以打开 PS，将按钮直接覆盖到 Menu 上。这个处理不算复杂，提取出的按钮都是与 Menu 分辨率相同的带透明度的图片，PS 里直接覆盖即可。少女歌剧小动画的 Menu 就采用了这种处理。</p>\n<p>如果是动态 Menu，将按钮制作为 PGS 字幕，在播放时切换字幕轨道来展示动画效果。超炮S3 的 Menu 就采用了这种处理。总监 Akarin 制作了一个方便的工具来制作 PGS 字幕，用法会在后续教程中介绍。</p>\n<p>最后再次强调一遍，菜单按钮完全是可选内容，实际上非常不推荐在这上面花费时间，本节教程的目的是教会大家提取按钮，方便了解原盘视频内容。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-mkv的抽流\"><a

OKEGui，也可以直接使用 tools 中的稳定版 MKVToolNix。</p>\n<p>mkvtoolnix-gui.exe 提供了图形界面的 mkv 处理程序，但是没有包含抽流工具 mkvextract.exe 的功能。因此这里推荐使用第三方的辅助 gui 程序，你可以在这里下载：<a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmkvextractgui/%E3%80%82\">https://sourceforge.net/projects/gmkvextractgui/。</a></p>\n<p>如果你使用的是安装版 MKVToolNix，你可以把 gMKVExtractGUI 解压到任何地方，它会根据注册表找到 MKVToolNix 的位置。如果你使用的是 portable 版 MKVToolNix，那么需要解压到 MKVToolNix 根目录下。</p>\n<p>打开 gMKVExtractGUI，把 mkv 拖进去。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-03/image12.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>gMKVExtractGUI 也支持批量拖入 mkv，拖入之后依次选择要抽取的轨道即可。</p>\n<p>另外，mkv 的视频和音轨也可以用 eac3to 抽取，但是 PGS 字幕不要用 eac3to 抽。</p>\n<p>一般 mkv 中的 PGS 字幕是经过 zlib 压缩过的，而 eac3to 并不会解压，而是直接提取出来塞到 sup 文件里，这样提取出的 sup 文件无法正常播放。</p>\n<p>处理方法有很多，手动解压再封装，或者封装时指定不做压缩。但是最好的方法还是，mkv 里的 PGS 字幕就老老实实用 mkvextract 抽。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-mp4的抽流\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-mp4的抽流\">#</a> (5).

视频的压制</h3>\n<p>视频，一般都是要经过有损压制。压制过程可以分为预处理（pre-process）和重编码（encode）。</p>\n<p>预处理就是通过 VapourSynth 或者 AviSynth 读取视频，对画面进行各种处理；重编码则是将处理过后的视频画面进行编码、压缩，以将视频体积减小到合适范围。</p>\n<p>以 VapourSynth 为例，整个压制过程靠 VapourSynth 的 vspipe，结合 x265 或者 x264 编码器，通过管道（pipe）连接来完成。</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

音频的压制</h3>\n<p>在压制音频之前，我们需要先做另一件事，音轨检查。</p>\n<p>音轨检查需要检查：1.是否为空音轨，2.是否为重复音轨。</p>\n<p>蓝光原盘里有空音轨或者重复音轨这种事情极其常见，并且即使是空音轨，它的码率也和普通音轨完全一样，仅凭外表无法分辨。</p>\n<p>最常见的情况是，部分集数有评论音轨，部分集数没有。早期原盘为了统一格式，所有集都是双音轨，那么没有评论音轨的集数怎么办，要么填一条空音轨，要么重复主音轨。这俩在原盘里码率都是一样，空或者重复对制作商来说没有区别，哪种情况都有可能。</p>\n<p>判断空音轨很容易，在播放器里前后拉一遍，完全没有声音的就是空音轨，当然确保你此时打开了系统声音。</p>\n<p>重复音轨的判断就比较麻烦，因为你不知道是否只有某些地方做了改变，而其他地方完全相同。比较典型的是《魔法少女小圆 叛逆的物语》，晓美焰黑化的那段配音，有正常版，还有个音轨专门换成了病娇版，其他的部分完全一样，你不看介绍都不知道就那么一分钟的配音不同。</p>\n<p>判断两条好像一样的音轨是不是真的重复，以前靠肉眼看频谱，现在已经有自动化工具了，会在后续教程中介绍给大家。</p>\n<p>之后就是对音轨进行编码。</p>\n<p>按照 VCB-Studio 规范，对于不同内容的音轨，有不同的编码要求。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-03/image13.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>更详细的说明可以参考<a href=\"https://github.com/vcb-s/VCB-S_Collation/blob/master/specification.md\">整理规范</a>。</p>\n<p>简单来说，如果原盘中为无损音轨，正片和特典的主音轨需要 flac 编码，而评论轨和真人特典的音轨需要 aac 编码；如果原盘中为有损音轨，在码率不太高时保留原样，码率较高时转为 aac 编码。</p>\n<p>flac 编码，实际在我们使用 eac3to 抽取时就可以直接抽取并转码为 flac（使用的是最高压缩等级）。如果你抽取为 wav，也可以手动转为 flac。</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

href=\"https://github.com/nu774/qaac/releases%E3%80%82\">https://github.com/nu774/qaac/releases。</a></p>\n<p>qaac 依赖于 Apple 的 CoreAudioToolbox 组件，所以你需要安装 iTunes，如果你不想安装 iTunes 的话，可以在  qaac.exe / qaac64.exe 的同目录下建立一个 QTfiles / QTfiles64 文件夹，并在其中放置与之匹配的 32 位 / 64 位依赖。QTFiles 的获取可以使用 <a href=\"https://github.com/nu774/makeportable\">makeportable</a>，也可以直接下载别人导出完的：<a href=\"https://github.com/AnimMouse/QTFiles%E3%80%82\">https://github.com/AnimMouse/QTFiles。</a></p>\n<p>如果你想让 qaac 支持 flac、WavPack（.wv） 等格式的输入，则需要在根目录放置与 qaac 位数相匹配的依赖，可以参照 <a href=\"https://github.com/nu774/qaac/wiki/Installation\">https://github.com/nu774/qaac/wiki/Installation</a> 进行配置。以 flac 为例，你可以去 <a href=\"https://www.rarewares.org/lossless.php\">https://www.rarewares.org/lossless.php</a> 下载一个 libFLAC 的 dll 文件，以 libFLAC_dynamic.dll 或 libFLAC.dll 命名放置在 qaac 的根目录下。</p>\n<p>最后额外介绍一点 32bit 音轨无损编码内容。</p>\n<p>普通无损音轨位深为 16bit，Hi-Res 常见为 24bit，而一些最新的 Hi-Res 则有 32bit。32bit 又分为 32 位整数和 32 位浮点。幸运的是，目前蓝光原盘里我们还看不到这些烦人的 32bit 音轨。</p>\n<p>flac 虽然有对 32 位整数格式的规范，<sub>但并没有编码器实现</sub> 在 1.4.0 版本之后增加了对 32 位整数的编解码支持，至于 32 位浮点则完全不支持。</p>\n<p>qaac 支持 alac 无损编码，能够支持 32 位整数格式的编解码，编码命令请自行查阅 qaac 文档。</p>\n<p>一个对 32bit 音轨支持较好的格式/编码器为 WavPack，同时支持 32 位整数和 32 位浮点。你可以在这里下载并查阅其用法：<a

mp4，不过可靠性较差，一般不建议使用。</p>\n<p>虽然 L-SMASH 比较可靠，但是其对于源的要求也较高，如果源是由 BD 压制出来的，那么 L-SMASH 是一个最好的选择；如果源是 web  或者录播等，那么使用 L-SMASH 反而可能出错。而且 L-SMASH 只支持封装 AVC、HEVC、VC1 的视频编码格式以及  AAC、DTS、E-AC-3、AC-3、MP3 等常规音频编码格式，如果你需要封装 VVC、AV1 等新生编码视频格式或者 OPUS  等音频格式就需要使用其他的 mp4 封装工具了，比如 gpac 的 mp4box，你可以从 <a href=\"https://www.videohelp.com/software/MP4Box\">https://www.videohelp.com/software/MP4Box</a>

Superstar!! 第一季的第二卷原盘作为例子，你可以在这里下载 <a href=\"https://nyaa.si/view/1502837%E3%80%82%E5%BD%93%E7%84%B6%E4%BD%A0%E4%B9%9F%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%89%8B%E9%87%8C%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96\">https://nyaa.si/view/1502837。当然你也可以使用手里其他</a> BD 原盘，他们大同小异，没有本质区别。</p>\n<p>确保你已经安装好 MediaInfo，你可以在这里下载 <a href=\"https://mediaarea.net/zh-CN/MediaInfo/Download/Windows%E3%80%82%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E6%8E%A8%E8%8D%90%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E7%89%88%EF%BC%8C%E5%B9%B6%E5%BC%80%E5%90%AF%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8B%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E3%80%82\">https://mediaarea.net/zh-CN/MediaInfo/Download/Windows。我们推荐使用安装版，并开启以下功能。</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-02/image01.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>这样把鼠标移动到媒体文件上就可以快速显示其简要信息，帮助我们判断内容。</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-bdmv结构\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-bdmv结构\">#</a> 1. BDMV结构</h2>\n<p>BD 全称 Blu-ray Disc，不法分子通过 MakeMKV 之类的软件将其破解，并抓取成 PC 可以直接读取的形式——BDMV。</p>\n<p>通常遇到的原盘，其根目录结构应该如下，包括：BD 根目录(BDROM)、特典 CD(BONUS CD)、扫图(SCANS)。其中特典 CD 和扫图可能不存在，也可能合并进 BDROM 目录。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-02/image02.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>BDROM 目录应当包括两个子目录：BDMV、CERTIFICATE。CERTIFICATE 与数字版权以及制作商有关，我们可以直接忽略它。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-02/image03.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>BDMV 则是原盘的主体部分：CLIPINF 以及 bdmv 文件规定了原盘如何播放，BACKUP 是其备份；META 中包括描述原盘信息的 xml  文件以及 logo 图片，由于图片分辨率不高，我们一般弃之不用；PLAYLIST 主要存储章节文件；STREAM 则是蓝光视频所在的地方。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-02/image04.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>另外，有些时候也会见到 AUXDATA、BDJO、JAR 等目录，对蓝光结构感兴趣的同学可以自行进一步研究蓝光规范和工作原理。对我们来说关注的只有两个，一个是 PLAYLIST，还有一个是 STREAM。</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-stream文件夹\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-stream文件夹\">#</a> 2. STREAM文件夹</h2>\n<p>STREAM 文件夹里有各种 m2ts 文件，有可以播放的视频文件，也有无法生成缩略图的文件。这些文件从 00000 开始编号，以不一定连续的数字依次排列。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-02/image05.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>以星团这张原盘为例，这些文件分别是：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>00 Menu（菜单），这是一个比较特殊的特典，每张原盘都有，是原盘播放时的菜单页面。</li>\n<li>05、06 正片，通常一集 24 分钟的正片大小为 7GiB 左右，可以通过体积快速找出正片。</li>\n<li>08 真人特典，这类内容往往体积较大。</li>\n<li>09、10 该系列特殊的 ED 特典。</li>\n<li>07、11、12 版权警告、温馨提示、制作商 logo。</li>\n<li>01、02、03、04 无法播放，利用 mediainfo 快速查看，发现显示为 PGS 字幕。实际上它们并不是 PGS 字幕，而是 IGS，一种比 PGS 更加复杂的东西，用于存储 Menu 的文字画面或者动态效果。</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3-有效内容\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-有效内容\">#</a> 3. 有效内容</h2>\n<p>并不是 STREAM 文件夹内所有内容都需要制作，只需要制作其中的有效内容。我们这样定义有效内容：跟当前番剧有关联的所有内容。</p>\n<p>按照这个定义，没有出现番剧相关信息的制作商 logo、版权警告（如 07、12）就不属于有效内容，制作时候不用带上。01、02、03、04  没有视频或者音频，无法制作，可以直接舍弃。当然严格意义上它们属于有效内容，丢弃有些可惜。在后续课程中我们将介绍提取并利用这部分内容的方法，在有爱的情况下可以选择性地使用。在通常情况下，直接丢弃也没有问题。剩下的 00、05、06、08、09、10，毫无疑问都属于有效内容范畴，这个比较容易判断。</p>\n<p>现在问题来了，大家判断下，11 这个温馨提示是否属于有效内容？</p>\n<p>我们判断它属于有效内容，原因是：它的背景画面是番剧中的场景。</p>\n<p>所以判定其实很松，只要有一点相符，那就带上。被扔掉的，一般就是，换个其他番剧（哪怕是同一家制作商）带上，也毫无违和感的。</p>\n<p>另外有时也会遇到，一个番剧的原盘里带有另一个番剧的广告之类的特典，这在早期的原盘和非日版的原盘中比较常见。这种情况，我们可以直接丢弃。</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-文件格式\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-文件格式\">#</a> 4. 文件格式</h2>\n<p>我们现在把 05 正片拖进 mediainfo 里，选择 视图-文本 查看详细信息。</p>\n<p>可以发现视频是 AVC(H.264) YUV420P8 编码，这是最常见的 BD 视频格式。一些上古原盘可能有 MPEG2 格式，最新的 UHD 原盘可能会有 HEVC(H.265) YUV420P10 格式，而杜比视界（Dobly Vision）原盘则可能有双视频轨道。</p>\n<p>再来看音轨，这里是 PCM 格式，常见的还有 DTS-HD MA、TrueHD、DTS、AC3 等。</p>\n<p>另外这个正片还有 PGS 字幕轨，比较少见，如果有字幕轨我们都会带着。</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-playlist文件夹\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-playlist文件夹\">#</a> 5. PLAYLIST文件夹</h2>\n<p>现在我们回到 PLAYLIST 文件夹，会看到一堆 mpls 文件。每个 mpls 文件指明了一个播放单元，每个播放单元可以由 1 或多个 m2ts 文件组合而成。</p>\n<p>用播放器直接打开 mpls 文件，看看会发生什么？potplayer、mpc-be 可以直接播放整个播放单元的内容，mpv 表示无法播放。</p>\n<p>其实 mpv 也是可以播放 mpls 的，不过需要使用命令行操作。</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\" style=\"background-color:#ffffff;--shiki-dark-bg:#121212;color:#393a34;--shiki-dark:#dbd7caee\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-text\"><span class=\"line\"><span>mpv bd://mpls/&#123;mpls number&#125; --bluray-device=&#123;path to bdrom&#125;</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>mpls number 指定要播放的 mpls 编号，蓝光原盘的路径指定到 BDROM，即 BDMV 的上一级目录。</p>\n<p>当然，嫌麻烦的同学也可以再装个 mpc 或者 pot 来看 mpls。</p>\n<p>将 mpls 拖到 mediainfo 里可以查看这个播放单元含有的所有 m2ts 的信息。常见的情况是，一张原盘里的两集正片在 mpls 里会连在一起。同时我们也可以看到章节信息，但是这里可能只显示第一个 m2ts 的章节信息。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-02/image06.png\" alt=\"img\" /></p>\n<p>那么如何完整获取章节信息呢，需要用到唯一指定章节处理工具——ChapterTool，这将在下一节教程中详细介绍。</p>\n<h2 id=\"6-特殊内容\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#6-特殊内容\">#</a> 6. 特殊内容</h2>\n<p>最后讲一下原盘里比较特殊的内容。首先是 Menu，除了上面例子里这种和一般视频没什么区别的 Menu 之外，还有一帧式的 Menu。</p>\n<p>这种 Menu 只有一张图，播放时一闪而过，容易被当成无效内容而忽视。当存在这种 Menu 时，有可能存在独立的只有音轨的 m2ts，要注意检查。</p>\n<p>这里也提醒大家，一定要用 mediainfo 检查所有 m2ts，确保没有遗漏有效内容。</p>\n<p>总结下，Menu 大概分为这几类：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(动态画面+BGM).m2ts</li>\n<li>(静态画面+BGM).m2ts</li>\n<li>裸图.m2ts</li>\n<li>裸图.m2ts + BGM.m2ts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>这几种我们会有不同的处理方式，将在后续教程中详细介绍。</p>\n<p>还有一个比较特殊的内容是画册，你会看到几十甚至上百个只有一帧的 m2ts，它们是官方提供的一堆色或者不色的图片。Sonny Boy  原盘就是一个典型，里面有数百张图片，当时我们大受震撼。对于这些图片，截取为无损 png，作为特典带着就行，后续教程会给出批量处理的方法。</p>\n",

从零开始认识视频</h1>\n<p>视频已经与我们的日常生活息息相关，无论是在电视、电影院、电脑还是手机上，视频都随处可见。视频文件一般至少由视频轨以及音轨构成。本章将介绍视频轨的基本构成，包括色彩，采样，帧率，扫描方式，编码等方面。这些都是影响最终视频画面的关键因素。同时，本章还将涉及到视频文件的结构，即如何将以上元素整合在一起构建一个完整的视频文件。通过深入了解这些内容，读者将能够更好地理解视频制作和编辑的基本原理，为后续的视频处理工作奠定坚实的基础。</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-颜色\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-颜色\">#</a> 1. 颜色</h2>\n<p>视频文件中，颜色主要由色彩空间（color space）、色彩原色（color primaries）、传输特性（transfer characteristics）、矩阵系数（matrix coefficients）以及色彩范围（color range）定义。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-色彩空间-color-space\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-色彩空间-color-space\">#</a> (1). 色彩空间 color space</h3>\n<p>视频的色彩空间是指用来描述视频颜色的一套规则，也可以说是定义视频中颜色的系统。常见的视频色彩空间有 RGB、YUV 和 YCbCr 等。RGB 是指红绿蓝三原色，也就是我们常说的光源的色彩系统；而 YUV 和 YCbCr  是指亮度（Y）和色度（U、V 或者 Cb、Cr）三个分量组成的颜色系统，一般用于描述传输视频信号。在 YUV 和 YCbCr  中，亮度是视频图像中最重要的成分，因为它直接决定了视频画面的明暗度，而色度则描述颜色中的色调和饱和度。</p>\n<h3

色彩原色的概念</h4>\n<p>在色彩学中，色彩原色指的是无法通过任何其他颜色混合而得到的颜色。在不同的色彩空间系统中，有不同的原色组合。可以分为 “叠加型” 和 “消减型” 两种系统。“叠加型” 的颜色系统通过不同颜色的光（原色），在黑暗的背景上产生颜色，一般是以光源投射的形式出现，例如 CRT。这套原色系统常被称为 “RGB 色彩空间”，亦即由红（R）绿（G）蓝（B）所组合出的色彩系统。相对的，“消减型” 的色彩系统是通过从  “白” 光中消去不需要的光谱（原色）。一般来说这种系统在透明或者反射介质上产生颜色，例如印刷品使用的 CMY 或者 CMYK  色彩系统。由于视频是以发光的显示屏作为载体显示的，因此在这里只讨论 RGB 颜色系统。</p>\n<h4 id=\"lms-与-xyz-色彩空间\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#lms-与-xyz-色彩空间\">#</a> LMS 与 XYZ 色彩空间</h4>\n<p>“原色”并不是物理学中的一个概念，而是一个由人类视觉系统决定的生物学概念。人眼视网膜上有两种对光敏感的细胞：视杆细胞和视锥细胞。其中前者虽然数量庞大，而且对光非常敏感，但是主要负责夜视力，颜色学里面基本忽略；后者敏感度较低（相比前者通常 1 个光子就可以产生响应，后者需要大概 10  个），但是却能区分颜色。具体来讲，不同波长的光会使人眼中的三种视锥细胞产生不同的反应，从而导致我们感受到不同的颜色。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/Cone-fundamentals-with-srgb-spectrum.svg\" alt=\"Normalized response spectra of human cones\" />人类视锥细胞对单色光谱刺激的归一化反应光谱，波长为纳米。</p>\n<p>这三种视锥细胞的归一化的频响曲线如上图。所谓频响（频率响应）指的是视锥细胞对各个波长的光的敏感度，也就是光的颜色对于视锥细胞的刺激能力。人眼中共有三种不同类型的视锥细胞，它们对光的波长的反应各不相同。具体来说：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>S型视锥细胞（short-wavelength cones，也称蓝色光感受器）对可见光的波长最短的部分做出反应，对紫色到蓝色的光较敏感；</li>\n<li>M型视锥细胞（middle-wavelength cones，也称绿色光感受器）对可见光的波长在中间部分做出反应，对绿色的光较敏感；</li>\n<li>L型视锥细胞（long-wavelength cones，也称红色光感受器）对可见光的波长最长的部分做出反应，对黄色到红色的光较敏感。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>根据这个我们可以知道，假设每种细胞输出都是标量，那么我们要表示颜色也至少需要三个分量，三个原色。 然后直接用 L/M/S 细胞的输出的数值来表示颜色就已经用非负值表示所有人眼可以区分的颜色了。因此 LMS  颜色系统主要用于描述人类视网膜中的三种不同类型的视锥细胞对不同波长光的敏感度，它可以准确地描述人类视网膜中的颜色感知。在视觉心理学、医学等领域，LMS系统被广泛应用。</p>\n<p>然而，在色彩科学中，人们更多地使用其他颜色空间，如 CIE XYZ 颜色空间。这是因为 CIE XYZ 颜色空间能够更好地描述光的亮度和色度，并且更符合色彩测量和色彩管理的需求。CIE XYZ  颜色空间是为标准化色彩测量和色彩管理而设计的，可以精确地计算不同颜色之间的差异和色彩变换，因此它在许多领域被广泛应用，如计算机图形学、印刷、电影制作等。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/CIE-XYZ-Color-Space.svg\" alt=\"CIE XYZ color space\" />CIE XYZ 色彩空间</p>\n<p>XYZ 色彩空间是由三个假想的原色 X、Y、Z 定义的，所有可见的颜色都位于一个三维锥状区域内（见图 CIE XYZ 色彩空间  (a)），选择这三种颜色是为了使所有可见的颜色都能被描述为纯正成分的总和（这个色彩空间分布于第一象限），其中 Y  成分对应于一个颜色的感知亮度或明度，它的原点是黑点（a）图中的 S，E 是表示中性（灰色）颜色的轴。如果将 RGB 色彩空间映射到 XYZ  空间则是如（b）图所示的一个立方体。</p>\n<p>如前所述，XYZ 色彩空间的亮度沿 Y 轴增加，从位于坐标原点的黑点 S  开始（X=Y=Z=0）。色相与亮度无关。例如，白色是明亮的颜色，而灰色被认为是不太亮的白色。换句话说，白色和灰色的色度是一样的，而明度不同。因此在 XYZ 色彩空间中，色相与 Y 值无关。为了方便地描述相应的 &quot;纯 &quot;色相和饱和度，CIE系统还定义了三个色度值：</p>\n<p>x=XX+Y+Zx=X+Y+ZX y=YX+Y+Zy=X+Y+ZY z=ZX+Y+Zz=X+Y+ZZ</p>\n<p>其中 x+y+z=1x+y+z=1。那么在归一化以后，表示某一个颜色只需要两个参数，比如 <code>x</code> 和 <code>y</code>，且 <code>x</code> 和 <code>y</code> 都是 <code>[0, 1]</code> 范围内，且由于 <code>z &gt;= 0</code> ， <code>x + y &lt;= 1</code>。那么上述的公式就描述了从 X、Y、Z 坐标系到三维平面 X+Y+Z=1X+Y+Z=1 的中心投影，其中原点 S 是投影中心。如下图所示：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/CIE-X-Y-Chromaticity-Diagram.svg\" alt=\"CIE x, y chromaticity diagram\" />CIE x, y 色度图</p>\n<p>因此，对于任意的 XYZ 空间中的色点 A=(Xa,Ya,Za)A=(Xa,Ya,Za)，相应的色度坐标 a=(xa,ya,za)a=(xa,ya,za) 是通过将线 SAˉSAˉ 与  X+Y+Z=1X+Y+Z=1 相交得到的。那么最终 x,y 色度图只需要去除 ZZ 分量 zaza 即可得到，而这个结果就是著名的马蹄形 CIE x, y 色度分布图（见图 (c)）。马蹄形的区域里面表示着所有可见的颜色，其中上边沿一圈是各种波长的单色光对应的点。</p>\n<p>如上图所示 RGB 三种颜色就是色彩原色（color primaries），由这三个点构成的三角形内的色度都可以用三原色的不同配比组成。同理，CMY  三原色框选出来的三角形区域中的颜色也可以用这三原色通过不同配比表示。这是由颜色的可线性叠加的性质造成的，也就是说任意从马蹄形区域中选三个不共线的点，就可以做三原色，表示三点框出来的三角形内的所有颜色。所以三原色是不唯一的。</p>\n<h4 id=\"视频中的色彩原色\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#视频中的色彩原色\">#</a>

白点</h4>\n<p>实际的 <em>primaries</em> 是个四元组，除了三个顶点（原色）的 x,y 坐标之外，还需要指定白点的位置。  形象地说，不同光照下颜色是不同的，而表示着光照条件的就是白点。白点有着不同的标准，比如 E  系列标准照明体，是频谱内全是平的，虽然理想，但是你现实中看电视绝对不是这种光照条件。我们平时常见的的 D 系列是模拟日光下的情况，例如常用的  D65 标准源大约相当于晴天室外正午时的光照，对应色温约为 6504 K。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-传输特性-transfer-characteristics\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-传输特性-transfer-characteristics\">#</a> (2). 传输特性 transfer characteristics</h3>\n<p>前面讨论的 RGB 颜色其实都是用 <code>[0, 1]</code> 范围内的实数表示的。计算机显然不能真的表示实数，虽然浮点数可以近似表示实数，但是用浮点数来表示视频中的颜色效率非常低，我们还是希望用整数来表示。因此需要将连续的实数转化为整数，这个步骤被称为量化（quantization）。</p>\n<p>这个步骤看起来似乎并不是非常复杂。假设人类可以分辨的最低亮度是 1，那么我们直接记录它的倍数来表示更高的亮度。为了提高精度我们甚至可以假设这个能分辨的最低亮度是 10。像这样的量化，我们称之为<em>线性量化</em>。对应的颜色一般叫<em>线性光颜色</em>，表示数值与光的能量成正比（线性）关系。</p>\n<p>不过实际用起来有一个问题，就是人眼可以区分的亮度范围很广，在不同的亮度下的分辨能力却不同，也就是说，人眼对亮度的感受并不是线性的。以 8-bit 视频为例，如果在这么广的范围平分 256  个区间量化为对应的数字，会导致高亮度的区域，相邻亮度级之间区别不大甚至根本没有。低亮度区域则区别过大，丢失了很多本来可以区分的亮度级。</p>\n<p>所以为了更加好地利用可用的数值范围，我们使用非线性量化，低亮度区域相邻数值间的实际亮度差较低，高亮度的则大得多。 在这里描述量化后的数值与实际光的能量之间的对应关系函数就叫 <em>transfer</em>。这个词或许大家觉得陌生， <em>transfer</em> 在 DSP (digital signal processing) 中是传递（函数）的意思，是一个系统的输入和输出之间的数学关系，它描述了输入信号经过系统后产生的输出信号的变化规律。</p>\n<p>熟悉视频的读者可能会对“gamma 校正”这个名词更熟悉。早期这种线性与非线性光的映射操作叫 gamma 校正。这是因为在显像管电视时代，输入电压跟输出的亮度之间的关系大概是个 Out=IngammaOut=Ingamma 的关系。当时使用的 gamma 值大约为2.4，随后工程师发现这样的输入输出关系基本上与人眼感受到的亮度是对应的。所以现在的 transfer 会使用类似的公式，但是具体的参数有所不同。</p>\n<p>综上所述，线性光与非线性光之间的桥梁就是传输特性。</p>\n<p>一般我们做视频处理都是直接用非线性光做，这才是一般大家提的 RGB。为了严谨起见，如果需要特地区分，非线性量化会在对应变量加上 <code>'</code> 表示。比如 <code>R'G'B'</code> 表示非线性量化的 RGB，特点是每个数值之间对人眼来说亮度差异几乎一致。而不带角标的是线性的，跟物理上的能量直接对应。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-矩阵系数-matrix-coefficients\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-矩阵系数-matrix-coefficients\">#</a> (3). 矩阵系数 matrix coefficients</h3>\n<p>视频的 matrix coefficients（矩阵系数）是指在将 RGB（红绿蓝）颜色空间转换为 YUV（亮度、色度）颜色空间时，所使用的转换矩阵系数。</p>\n<h4 id=\"yuv-色彩空间\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#yuv-色彩空间\">#</a> YUV 色彩空间</h4>\n<p>在介绍矩阵系数之前，还需要引出 YUV

YUV，也有叫 YCbCr。</p>\n<h4 id=\"yuv-与-rgb\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#yuv-与-rgb\">#</a> YUV 与 RGB</h4>\n<p>以 Rec. 709 标准为例，是这样一个转换方式:</p>\n<p>[Y′ U V]=[0.21260.71520.0722 −0.1145720.3854280.5

也是另一种三“原色”，只不过 YUV 都不对应真实的颜色。Y 表示的人眼可见的亮度信息，而 UV 则表示纯颜色信息。 YUV 也可以通过先行操作转换到 RGB：</p>\n<p>[R′ G′ B′]=[101.5748 1−0.187324−0.468124 11.85560][Y′ U V]⎣</p>\n<p>⎡R′ G′ B′⎦⎤=⎣⎡1 1 10−0.1873241.85561.5748−0.4681240⎦⎤⎣⎡Y′ U V⎦</p>\n<p>⎤</p>\n<p>前文介绍过， RGB 都是 [0, 1] 之间的实数，那么根据 Y'UV 转换到 R'G'B' 的公式可以发现：Y'UV 的数值范围分别是 [0, 1][-0.5, 0.5] [-0.5, 0.5]。对上述公式稍加变换即可得到如下的内容：</p>\n<p>Y′=0.2126R′+0.7152G′+0.0722B′ U=0.5390(B′−Y′) V=0.6350(R′−Y′)Y′ U V=0.2126R′+0.7152G′+0.0722B′=0.5390(B′−Y′)=0.6350(R′−Y′)</p>\n<p>Y' 直接用 R'G'B' 表示，UV 则换了一种等价的表示方式。这里 U 和 V 分别是 B' / R' 与 Y' 的差，最后乘一个系数使得最后范围是 [-0.5, 0.5]。因此 UV 这里也叫色差信号，分别用 U/Cb 表示（B'-Y'），和 V/Cr 表示（R'-Y'）。</p>\n<p>注：在上述表达中，仅出现了 <code>Y'</code> 并没有出现 <code>U'</code> 或者 <code>V'</code>。这是因为 Y 是亮度，非线性量化的物理值，但 UV 在理论上是与亮度无关的，无需经过 gamma 校正。</p>\n<h4 id=\"matrix\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#matrix\">#</a> matrix</h4>\n<p>可以看到 YUV 和 RGB 互转是通过一个矩阵乘法进行的，这个矩阵就叫 <strong>matrix</strong> 。不同的标准转换矩阵不同，Rec. 601 和 Rec. 709 的差异尤其明显，当你使用了错误的转换矩阵就会发生偏色。RGB 转 YUV 与 YUV 转 RGB 的俩个矩阵互为逆矩阵，所以一般只指定一个，用 <strong>matrix</strong> 统称。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-色彩范围-color-range\"><a class=\"anchor\"

或者 <code>PC range</code>。而视频中更为常用被称为 <code>limited range</code> 的色彩范围。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>limited range 还有一个叫法叫 studio range，但在 VS 里面一般是统一称为 limited range。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>以 8-bit 为例，在 <code>limited range</code> 中 Y 的实际范围是 [16, 235]， UV 的范围是 [16, 240]。其中 128 是 UV 的中点 0，16 表示 -0.5，240 表示 0.5。</p>\n<h4 id=\"limited-range-的意义\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#limited-range-的意义\">#</a> limited range 的意义</h4>\n<p>有些读者可能会在这里产生疑问：我们用非线性量化是为了尽可能高效利用数值的范围，但这里却“浪费了”最高和最低的两段数字。</p>\n<p>在低端不使用的 16 个数字，学名叫 <code>footroom</code>，高的那段叫 <code>headroom</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HDI 标准中确实使用这部分不能用的数字表示 sync 信号。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>不使用这两段数字的主要理由如下：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>一个实际的传感器输出的信号必然伴随着随机噪声（白噪声），这些噪声（能量）可正可负。如果我们要求输出的 0 点就是 0，就意味着正噪声可以表示，负噪声一律变成了 0（截断）。这意味着平均的噪声不再是 0，0 点实际偏高了。因此 <code>footroom</code> 是必须保留的。</li>\n<li>在数字信号处理过程中，很多处理算法是不能保证输出的范围跟输入匹配的。很有可能在过程中发生 <code>overshoot</code>（过冲，高于输入上限）和 <code>undershoot</code>（低于输入下限）。对于这种情况，通常只需要使用 <code>clamp</code>，将超过上下限的数值钳位到对应的极值。但是很明显的，这是一个非线性的操作，这就会引入额外的噪声。<code>footroom</code> 和 <code>headroom</code> 的意义在于可以连续多个处理后一次性做这个 <code>clamp</code> 操作，以此避免多次引入非线性噪声。（这个操作可以近似理解为做四则运算的时候，多保留几位有效数字，最后再通过一次四舍五入得到需要的精度，而不是每做一步都做一次四舍五入）</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"range-的换算\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#range-的换算\">#</a> Range 的换算</h4>\n<p>虽然 YUV 视频一般是用 <code>limited range</code>，但是也有例外情况是 <code>full range</code>。以下是一个基于 8-bit 视频的公式：</p>\n<p>Ylimited=round(219255∗Yfull)+16Ylimited=round(255219∗Yfull)+16</p>\n<p>当然，在实际操作中在进行转换时应当使用更高的精度，那么在转换过程中出现的四舍五入导致的误差才可以被忽略。在 VS 的操作中可以将 8-bit 源先转换成 16-bit 源再进行后续处理。</p>\n<p>对于不同位深度的视频，以 8-bit 转 10-bit 为例：8-bit limited Y [16,235], UV [16,240]，转换到 10-bit limited，Y就是 [16⋅4, 235⋅4] 或者说 [64, 940]，UV 则是 [64, 960]。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>full 和 limited 在提高位宽 k bits 的时候的行为是不同的，limited 直接乘以 2^k 即可，但是 full 则要做一个完整的重映射，比如 8bit full Y 到 10bit full Y，需要做一个 <code>1023 * Y8 / 255</code> 的映射，不是直接乘以4了。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>UV 从 full range 转换到 limited range 有一个额外的注意点：limited range U/V 有奇数个数，正好 0  点两边是对称的，full range U/V 一共有 256 个数值，刨去 0  之外不是偶数，所以左右不对称了。因此根据选择，这个转换可以拥有两个相似但不等价的公式。而为了避免这个情况，可以在浮点数下运算，再四舍五入。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>full range UV 的时候有两种转换方式，因为 128 两侧的数字不一样多，但是 limited

里面的三原色和白点的位置，决定了可表示的颜色的范围。</li>\n<li>传输特性（transfer characteristics）：线性光和非线性光之间的纽带，形式为 Out=IngammaOut=Ingamma ，所以传统上也叫 gamma 校正。</li>\n<li>矩阵系数（matrix coefficients）：视频编码实际用的 YUV 颜色与显示用的 RGB 之间的转换矩阵。</li>\n<li>色彩范围（color range）：YUV 编码时每个分量所使用的亮度和颜色取值的范围。</li>\n</ol>\n<p>不同的视频标准（比如 SD 的 Rec. 601 和 HD 的 Rec. 709，UHD 使用的 Rec. 2020）会分别指定 primaries / transfer / matrix，我们在做相应的转换的时候可能需要指定所用的标准。</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-视频\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-视频\">#</a> 2. 视频</h2>\n<p>一个视频文件的视频轨有很多属性，包括上文详细说明的颜色，帧率（frame rate），帧率模式（frame rate mode），扫描模式（scanning system），色度抽样（chroma  subsampling），编码设置（encoding  settings）等。这些属性对视频最终呈现的效果都有着很大的影响。下文将详细解释帧率/帧率模式、扫描模式、色度抽样以及编码的基本概念。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-帧率与帧率模式\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-帧率与帧率模式\">#</a> (1). 帧率与帧率模式</h3>\n<p>视频帧率指的是每秒钟播放的帧数，它是衡量视频流畅度的重要指标之一。通常我们看到的视频帧率为 24 帧/秒、30 帧/秒、60 帧/秒等。</p>\n<p>帧率模式则指的是帧率变化的模式，主要有两种：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>固定帧率（<code>Constant Frame Rate</code>，简称 <code>CFR</code>）：视频的帧率在整个视频中保持不变，这种模式适用于大多数场景。</li>\n<li>可变帧率（<code>Variable Frame Rate</code>，简称 <code>VFR</code>）：视频的帧率会根据内容和需要，发生变化。例如，当视频画面中大部分时间静态不变，只有少数时间段需要高帧率时，就可以采用VFR模式。这样可以节省存储空间，同时保证视频画面的流畅。更多有关 VFR 的内容会在 30 fps 相关的教程中展示。</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"2-扫描模式\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-扫描模式\">#</a> (2). 扫描模式</h3>\n<p>视频的扫描模式指的是视频的扫描方式，目前主流的视频扫描模式有两种：隔行扫描（interlaced scan）和逐行扫描（progressive scan）。</p>\n<h4 id=\"隔行interlaced\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#隔行interlaced\">#</a> 隔行（interlaced）</h4>\n<p>隔行扫描也称为交错，它将画面分为奇数行和偶数行两个半场，每个半场称为一个“场”，奇数行的场称为顶场（top field），偶数行的场称为底场（bottom field）。它会先发送完整的一场（比如先发送  top，但这个先后顺序不是固定的），然后再发送另一场。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>先后顺序不是固定的，是指不同视频中，先 top field 还是先 bottom field 不一定，当然一个视频里面切换是很难的，一旦开始传输了，就只能依赖上一个顺序一直传了。不过有例外的情况，也就是孤场的情况，很少见。一般是低劣的剪辑导致的。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/progressive-vs-interlaced.jpg\" alt=\"progressive vs interlaced\" />逐行扫描与隔行扫描</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>注：图中的线条顺序可以理解为 CRT 电子枪扫描的轨迹。可以看到右图先扫描了其中一场，扫描完成后再扫描另一场，然后交替往复。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>这就导致隔行的视频，我们不用帧率 <code>frame rate</code> 来说，而是场的速度，<code>field rate</code>，是 “帧率” 的两倍。</p>\n<h4 id=\"逐行progressive\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#逐行progressive\">#</a> 逐行（progressive）</h4>\n<p>如同字面意思，它按照每一行的顺序依次扫描并显示每一行的亮度信息。与逐行扫描相比，它的主要优点在于画面更为清晰、细节更加丰富。但由于数据量更大，传输效率相较逐行扫描要低一些。</p>\n<h4 id=\"表示方式\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#表示方式\">#</a> 表示方式</h4>\n<p>逐行视频用 <code>p</code> 表示，比如常见的 <code>1080p</code> 表示 1080 高度的逐行视频，又比如我们经常用 24p 表示 24 fps 的逐行视频。 隔行视频则是 <code>i</code> 表示，<code>1080i </code>表示 1080 高度，每场 540 高度的视频。 而如果用帧率表示，<code>i</code> 需要用场的速度来表示，也就是<code>60i</code>，表示 60 场每秒或 30 “帧” 每秒的视频。</p>\n<h4 id=\"隔行扫描的特性\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#隔行扫描的特性\">#</a> 隔行扫描的特性</h4>\n<p>从上面的说明来看，似乎隔行视频只是先采集一张图然后分成两场分开传输，但这只是其中一种可能称为 PsF（progressive segment frame）。而实际的隔行或者交错视频，两场的采集时间不同。换句话说，以 <code>60i</code> 为例，每 1/60s 采集一场，这里的采集可以认为是摄像头曝光一次。因此当你遇到一个交错视频时，就会看到拉丝的现象、这是因为物体运动较快，由于采集时间不同，上下场的内容无法对齐。</p>\n<p>隔行视频在早期模拟电视的时候是必须的，当时的黑白电视使用隔行扫描显示画面。由于视觉暂留的存在，其实人在 CRT 上看60场每秒的视频比30fps的视频要连贯。这是由 CRT 的长余晖特性导致的。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-色度抽样chroma-subsampling\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-色度抽样chroma-subsampling\">#</a> (3). 色度抽样（chroma subsampling）</h3>\n<p>无论图片还是视频中的每一帧，都是一个矩形的像素阵组成的，每个像素用 RGB 或者 YUV 表示其颜色。就像前文对 YUV  的介绍，由于人对亮度的感知比对色度的感知更为敏感，因此用相同的采样数来表示亮度和色度会浪费大量的带宽和存储空间。视频削减UV的码率最主要的方式是通过 <code>chroma subsampling</code> 色度抽样（或称为下采样）的技术做的。（UV 统称是 <code>chroma</code>，Y 则叫 <code>luma</code>）。换句话说，多个像素共用一个 UV 的值。再换句话说，通过色度抽样技术，让 UV 的分辨率低于 Y 的分辨率，正好对应了人眼的亮度分辨率高于色度分辨率的特性。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>VS里面可能会简称 css</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/Chroma-subsampling.svg\" alt=\"Chroma subsampling\" />色度抽样</p>\n<p>值得注意的是，看这张图的时候，需要想象上中下三行其实叠在一起的。最左边 <code>2x2</code> 的四个像素，分别对应 <code>2x2 R'</code> <code>2x2 G'</code> <code>2x2 B'</code> 这是正常的大家熟知的形式，没有做<code>subsampling</code>。右边的 <code>YCbCr 444</code> 则是直接把 <code>RGB</code> 转换 <code>YCbCr</code> 但是依然没有下采样。接下去的几种都是下采样的方式。</p>\n<p>这里先说明一下<code>4:4:4</code>这种数字的含义：<code>I:J:K</code> 三个数，假设第一行 <code>I</code> 个像素，因为 <code>Y</code> 不会下采样，所以会有 <code>I</code> 个 <code>Y</code>，第二个 <code>J</code> 表示这一行有多少个 <code>UV</code>，再下一个 <code>K</code> 表示下面一行 <code>I</code> 个像素又编码了几个 <code>UV</code>。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>注：这里 <code>UV</code> 是以一对为单位的，意思是一个 <code>U</code> 一个 <code>V</code>。 一个 <code>UV</code>、一个 <code>UV</code> 对、一对 <code>UV</code>，描述的是相同的事物。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><code>4:4:4</code> 代表4个像素的行，第一行编码了 4 个 <code>UV</code>，第二行也编码了 4 个 <code>UV</code>。所以这两行 <code>YUV</code> 总共 8 个 Y，8 个 <code>UV</code>，没有下采样。</li>\n<li><code>4:2:2</code>表示 4 个像素的行，第一行编码两个 <code>UV</code>，第二行再编码两个 <code>UV</code>。相当于假设是 2 个像素的行，第一行共用一个 <code>UV</code>对，第二行共用一个 <code>UV</code>对，也就是图里面示意的样子</li>\n<li><code>4:1:1</code> 代表一行 4 个像素，第一行与第二行均为 1 个<code>UV</code>。</li>\n<li><code>4:2:0</code> 的意思是一行 4 个像素，第一行 2 个<code>UV</code>，第二行没有再编码<code>UV</code>了。于是两行共 8 个像素里面 只编码了 2 个<code>UV</code>对，换句话说，<code>2x2</code>的 4 个像素共享一个<code>UV</code>对。<code>4:2:0</code> 并不表示具体 <code>Cb/Cr</code>采样在哪里，只是表示多少个<code>Y</code>对应多少个 <code>Cb</code> 多少个 <code>Cr</code> 而已。图中为了表示多个像素共享一个<code>Cb/Cr</code>，所以把对应的框框画大了。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>一般来说，制作 BDRip 只有两个 css 需要遇到，分别是 444 和 420。422 一般只有母带会用。</p>\n<h4 id=\"色度位置chroma-location\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#色度位置chroma-location\">#</a> 色度位置（chroma location）</h4>\n<p>在进行色度抽样时，根据视频帧中的色度分量的放置位置，可以衍生出不同的色度位置。<code>chroma location</code> 也被称为 <code>chroma placement</code> ，一般缩写为 <code>chromaloc</code> 或 <code>cplace</code>。</p>\n<p>如色度抽样的示意图所展示的，<code>4:2:2</code>，<code>4:1:1</code>, <code>4:2:0</code> 中出现的虚线代表 <code>Y</code> 与 <code>UV</code> 的对齐关系。所以同样是 <code>4:2:0</code>  的色度抽样，就存在两种类型的 <code>chroma location</code> 。左侧的是 <code>JPEG/MPEG-1 chroma location</code>，<code>Cb</code>/<code>Cr</code> 对齐的是 2x2 像素的中点。右边的叫 <code>MPEG-2 chroma location</code>，<code>Cb</code>/<code>Cr</code> 对齐的是左边一列的中点。可以从名称中发现，第一种色度位置是用于 <code>MPEG-1</code> 和 <code>JPEG</code>；第二种是 <code>MPEG-2</code> 以及后续的视频编码标准（比如 AVC 和 HEVC）使用的。两种 <code>chroma location</code> 看似差别不大（0.5 像素的偏差），但实际上有着肉眼可见的区别。比如 <code>chroma shift</code> 类的瑕疵就可能是使用了错误的 <code>chroma location</code> 导致的。</p>\n<p>细心的读者可能会发现在 <code>MPEG-1 cplace</code> 中，<code>Cb</code> 中心点与实际下采样之前 <code>2x2</code> 个 <code>Cb</code> 的中心点都不重合；相对的 <code>MPEG-2</code> 的 <code>Cb</code> 中心点其实与原本的第一列的 <code>Cb</code> 的中心点是重合的。当中心点重合时计算量会小一点，因此当进行插值运算将下采样的结果恢复为 <code>4:4:4</code> 时，这种 <code>MPEG-2</code> 的排列方式更好。</p>\n<p>虽然上图的像素表示为一个方框，但理论中的像素可以认为是采样的是中点所在无穷小的点位置的<strong>值</strong>。虽然实际当中， 不管是采集设备还是显示设备，实际像素是有限面积的，但是这都是表示近似的概念。为了更好的理解像素，下采样等概念，下面再举一个例子：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/sample-grid.png\" alt=\"sample grid\" />sampling grid</p>\n<p>我们以扫描为例来说明，你可以认为你有一个标记有均匀排列的 N×MN×M 个点的阵列的透明薄膜， 覆盖在要扫描的图片上，然后你读取每个点底下那个点的颜色值，作为对应的像素的值。实际上我们说的像素，只有红色横线和竖线相交的 16 个点。这里面的采样点就是图中的 16 个整数坐标点，采样点是无穷小的点。</p>\n<p>然后我们再来说 <code>cplace</code>。以上图为例，假设是 4×44×4 的采样点，那么 Y 的采样点就在红线的交界处。444 下采样的时候，<code>Cb</code> 和 <code>Cr</code> 的采样点也跟 <code>Y</code> 的位置重合。假如是 420 下采样，则一共有 4 对采样点，假设这里考虑 420 JPEG/MPEG-1 下采样，则可以得到如下的 <code>Cb</code> 和 <code>Cr</code> 采样点：</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/sample-grid-cbcr.png\" alt=\"sample grid cbcr\" />sampling grid 420 JPEG/MPEG-1</p>\n<p>420 JPEG/MPEG-1 下 <code>Cb</code> <code>Cr</code> 采样点坐标： (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 0.5), (2.5, 2.5)，坐标<strong>并不是整数</strong>。另一种 420（MPEG-2）下 <code>Cb</code> <code>Cr</code> 采样点坐标： (0, 0.5), (2, 0.5), (0, 2.5), (2, 2.5)。刚才的 X-Y 坐标系就是 <code>sampling grid</code>。</p>\n<p>有了 <code>sampling grid</code> 的概念之后，很多图像变换就可以用这个概念解释，比如图片放大和缩小，这里不做展开。</p>\n<p>此外，对于这种非整数位置的采样点，其数值是通过函数插值确定的。比如一维函数中最简单的差值——线性插值，即相邻的点中点的值就是与之相邻两点的值的平均值。比如说，(0.5, 0.5) 这个点的值，就可以用相邻四个整数点的值的平均来估计。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-视频编码的基础概念\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-视频编码的基础概念\">#</a> (4). 视频编码的基础概念</h3>\n<p>现在我们来说说视频编码中的基础概念。前面我们讲了视频编码使用 YUV 来存放颜色，这样 <code>css</code> (<code>chroma subsampling</code>) 就可以减少一部分数据量。但是视频中的冗余信息显然不只如此。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/I_P_and_B_frames.svg\" alt=\"I P and B frames\" />I/P/B帧</p>\n<p>以这个吃豆豆的 4 帧视频为例。豆豆不断从右侧移动进来。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>首先黄色的部分每帧都是一模一样的，所以视频后面几帧是可以直接复制前面一帧的内容，这就可以再节约一部分码率。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>不过对于豆豆来说，这种直接复制前面一帧的对应区域的办法就行不通了。虽然豆豆是一样的，但是相邻帧的位置有变化。对此视频编码一般有运动预测或者运动补偿。也就是后一帧不光可以引用前一帧相同部分的像素，也可以引用其他部分的一个块的值。</p>\n<p>这样第二帧就完美了：白色的背景，黄色的从第一张图直接复制，豆豆是第一张图的虚线区域往左挪一点。这里一帧引用其他帧的内容我们就要 <code>ref</code>（<code>reference</code>），被引用的帧就被称作 <code>reference frame</code> 。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>第三帧问题又来了。屏幕上四个豆豆，前面的帧都只有3个。我们假设四个豆子各不相同，那么这第四个是没办法用前面的帧来替换了，我们就束手无策只能在这帧重新编码一下这个内容了么？对于最早期的视频编码标准来说，确实是如此。不过细心的读者可能会发现第四帧就有这第四个豆子。假设我们能未卜先知，是不是可以用第四帧来编码第三帧呢？这就是是第四帧到第三帧的反向的箭头。可能读者会存在疑问：视频是按顺序播放的，我们怎么知道下一帧的内容？这是因为视频虽然按顺序播放，但是不一定是按顺序解码的。我们可以先编码第四帧，然后再编码第三帧，播放时也是先解码第四帧，随后解码第三帧，在播放时，调整显示的顺序。</p>\n<p>这里就引入了两个时间戳的概念，由于这种利用未来预测当下的存在，视频存在两种时间戳 <code>dts</code> 和 <code>pts</code>。<code>dts</code> - <code>decode timestamp</code>；<code>pts</code> - <code>presentation timestamp</code>。<code>dts</code> 是解码器必须解码一帧的时间，这里图中第四帧的时间在第三帧之前。<code>pts</code> 是一帧需要展现到屏幕的时间戳，1、2、3、4，是依次递增的。</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"ipb-帧\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#ipb-帧\">#</a> I/P/B 帧</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>图中这四帧，第一帧是完整编码的，我们称之为 <code>I帧</code>, <code>intra-coded frame</code> ，又称作 <code>key 帧</code>。表示这帧不依赖其他帧，可以独立解码。</li>\n<li>第二帧只依赖过去的帧的内容，我们叫 <code>P 帧</code>，<code>predicated frame</code>。如前文所说，这早期的视频编码只有这一种预测帧，所以 P 就被占用了。</li>\n<li>按照前文的叙述，第三帧这种同时依赖前面第二帧和后面第四帧也一样是通过预测得到的，但是无奈 P 这种类型已经占用，为了区别于前文所提的仅向前预测的帧，所以发明了一个新词，叫 <code>B 帧</code>，双向预测帧 <code>bipredicated frame</code> 。这就是 I/P/B 帧的概念。</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"gop-idr\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#gop-idr\">#</a> GOP &amp; IDR</h4>\n<p>就像前文所说，I 帧总是可以被独立解码，而 P/B 帧必须参考其他帧。除非转场，由于视频的帧之间都会存在可以互相引用的内容，这些 P/B 帧可能会引用 I  帧以前的内容。这在顺序播放时并不会成为障碍，但如果需要跳转，则需要从这一帧所参考到的 I  帧开始逐级解码，很容易引起无法拖动进度条的现象。为了解决这个问题，视频编码器会在适当的时候插入一个可以用来开始解码的特殊的 I 帧，这种帧叫 <code>IDR</code> , <code>instantaneous decoder fresh</code>。</p>\n<p>在遇到 <code>IDR</code> 帧时，解码器可以立即丢弃前面已经解码的所有帧，直接从该 <code>IDR</code> 帧开始解码。这是因为 <code>IDR</code> 帧代表在该帧以后的内容不会引用该 <code>IDR</code> 之前的帧。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/GOP-Structure.svg\" alt=\"GOP Structure\" />GOP 结构 IBBPBBPBB</p>\n<p>两个 I 帧之间的这些帧，包含第一个 I 帧，但不包含第二个，我们称之为 <code>GOP</code> （<code>Group of pictures</code>）。上图是一个可以表示为 <code>IBBPBBPBB</code> 的 GOP 结构，箭头表示参考关系。从图中可以看出，在第 6 帧（P 帧）以后的两个 B 帧均参考了第 9 帧（I 帧），这种 GOP 中的帧可以参考其他 GOP 的情况被称为<code>open GOP</code>。相对的，如果这两个 I 帧均为 IDR，则由于 IDR 帧的特殊性， GOP 中的帧既不能向第一个 IDR 帧以前的内容参考，也不可以向下一个 IDR 帧以后的内容参考，那么这个 GOP 就被称为 <code>closed GOP</code>。</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://guides.vcb-s.com/media/basic-guide-01/GOP-Structure-Transmission.svg\" alt=\"GOP Structure Transmission\" />GOP 结构传输</p>\n<p>上图是 GOP 的实际传输情况。第一个 GOP 的最后两个 B 帧是在第二个 GOP 的 I  帧之后传输的。对于这种情况，解码器如果从第二个GOP开始解码，会忽略中间的两个 B 帧（他们甚至可能无法解码，因为是 B 帧，可能依赖上一个  GOP 的帧）。此外，细心的读者可能会注意到：第二个条中表示一帧的方块的长度其实表示了帧的数据的相对尺寸的，可以看到 I 远大于 P ， P  远大于 B。所以一般视频里 I 的数量最少，P 其次，B 最多。</p>\n<p>根据上文提出的概念，<code>closed GOP</code> 内的帧只能互相参照，不能参照这个区间之外的内容，这就是可以完整切割并保证播放的最⼩单元。所以，在不重新编码的前提下，视频的切割（⽐如 mkvtoolnix），⼀定是从⼀个 IDR 开始切割，切割到另⼀个 IDR 之前⼀帧，或者末尾。</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-视频文件\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-视频文件\">#</a> 3. 视频文件</h2>\n<p>这一节将会剖析视频文件，分析其构成。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-容器\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-容器\">#</a> (1). 容器</h3>\n<p>看过<a href=\"https://vcb-s.com/archives/2726\">科普</a>的应该了解到<strong>容器</strong>的概念了，现在一定明白 <code>mkv</code> 比 <code>mp4</code> 画质好这种说法非常荒谬。</p>\n<p>现实中我们遇到的视频，一般是 <code>mp4</code>、<code>mkv/webm</code>、<code>mov </code>甚至 <code>avi</code>、<code>wmv</code> 这些后缀的文件，对于这些文件格式，我们称为<strong>容器(container)</strong>，意为承载其他东西的文件。</p>\n<p>为什么需要容器呢？因为视频 raw 一般无法独立使用，绝大多数情况要搭配声音播放。以 VCB-S 的 BDRip 为例，多条音轨也很常见，主音轨之外可能还有评论音轨。有些甚至还有字幕轨道。这些复杂性就意味着需要一个足够灵活的“容器”来承载这些轨道。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-轨道\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-轨道\">#</a> (2).

<code>mkv</code> 名字来源于俄罗斯套娃，其实一个 mkv 里面分 <code>segment</code>，每个 <code>segment</code> 才包括 <code>track</code>。<code>segment</code> 才是我们一般意义上说的一个视频（包括音频视频等等），因此可以发现，mkv就是在做这样的套娃操作。其中 <code>segment

的目标。也就是最不济也可以根据时间戳 seek 到对应的 cluster。</p>\n<p>这里面概念较多，其中 <code>discardable</code> 这个概念不是很重要，不被引用的帧都是

<code>track1</code>（视频）、<code>track2</code>（音频）都是分 <code>frame</code> 存放的。然后你有时候用 <code>mkvmerge</code> 切割时会发现，pcm 音频明明是可以完美按照 <code>sample</code> 切割的，但切割后却会出现 audio delay？就是这里的 <code>frame</code> 在作怪。<code>mkvmerge</code> 只能按照整数个 <code>frame</code> 来切割（音视频都是如此），即使是 <code>pcm</code> 音频。</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>这里会发现部分 timestamp 并不是按照顺序出现的，这个就是因为 GOP 在传输过程中不同帧解码顺序的需求造成的，具体内容参见 GOP

最新的特性还未支持，整体算是物美价廉。</p>\n<p>本指南<strong>基于 Windows 10 Powershell</strong>，其它操作系统基本也可参考使用。虽然本文基于 Canokey Pigeon，但大部分内容均可适用于其他硬件密钥，包括但不限于 Yubikey，Feitian key 等。同时本文的 <a href=\"https://editst.com/2022/canokey-guide/#OpenPGP\">OpenPGP 部分</a>也可单独作为比较完善的 PGP 使用指南来参考，<a href=\"https://editst.com/2022/canokey-guide/#PIV\">PIV 部分</a>基本可以说是目前最完整的中文使用指南。</p>\n<h2 id=\"基础配置\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#基础配置\">#</a> 基础配置</h2>\n<p>拿到后插入电脑会自动弹出 <a href=\"https://console.canokeys.org\">Canokey Web Console</a> 提示，也可通过自行访问，注意<strong>目前只支持 Chromium 内核浏览器</strong>，点击右上角连接，如果失败请尝试重新插拔后等待一会重试。</p>\n<p>连接成功后会显示 Canokey 的信息，首先进入 <code>Settings</code> 设置全局的 <code>Admin PIN</code>（默认 <code>123456</code>） <strong>并牢记</strong>，同时可以配置部分选项，个人建议把 <code>WebUSB prompt enabled</code> 关闭，有些烦人。</p>\n<p>注意这里的 <code>Admin PIN</code> <strong>只用于</strong> <a href=\"https://console.canokeys.org\">Canokey Web Console</a> 的 <code>Settings</code>，与下方所有 <code>PIN</code> 均无关，请勿混淆，如觉得麻烦也可跳过这一步。</p>\n<h2 id=\"otp\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#otp\">#</a> OTP</h2>\n<p>One-time Password (OTP) 是最常见的二步验证方法，主要分为 HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP) 和 Time-based One-time Password  (TOTP)，由于绝大部分平台支持的都是后者，本文仅介绍 TOTP。当然国内平台爱用的短信验证码也算一种  OTP，但是这种方法有其缺陷，并不自主可控。</p>\n<p>如果那你使用过 Google Authenticator 之类的软件，那你一定对 TOTP 不陌生，其最常见的形式是一个有着 30 秒倒计时的六位数字，本质上是基于一个预共享的密钥和当前时间计算出的验证码。</p>\n<p>通常网站会给出一个二维码让我们扫描，其内容一般如下</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes vitesse-light vitesse-dark\"

参数，也就是密钥。部分网站可能会直接给出一个密钥，同样添加即可。Canokey 最多支持存储 128 个密钥，反正我是用不完。还可以通过  Yubico Authenticator 来管理和读取 OTP，可能需要到设置中指定 custom reader 为 canokey。</p>\n<h2 id=\"fido2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#fido2\">#</a> FIDO2</h2>\n<p>首先引用<a href=\"https://flyhigher.top/develop/2160.html\">谈谈 WebAuthn</a> 的一段的介绍：</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FIDO2 标准主要包括四个部分，其一是用于网站和访客设备交互的 WebAuthn，而 Client to Authenticator  Protocol 2（CTAP2，客户端-认证器协议）作为 WebAuthn  的补充，则是用于访客的设备和认证器交互的协议。标准的其他两个部分则是 U2F 和 UAF 规范。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>实际上这部分的使用是最简单的，只需要在支持的网站或应用中添加硬件密钥即可，目前大部分是用作 2FA，我自己常用的包括 GitHub,  Cloudflare, Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook 等，更多支持 FIDO2/U2F/TOTP  的网站可以参考 <a href=\"https://2fa.directory/int/\">2FA Directory</a>。</p>\n<p>注意部分网站添加时会首先弹出含有 <code>Windows Hello</code> 的选项，需要<strong>点击取消</strong>跳过，再添加硬件密钥。首次添加时需要自定义 <code>PIN</code>，牢记即可。</p>\n<p>目前 Microsoft 账户支持使用硬件密钥实现单因素登录，即无需密码直接登录，可以进入账户的<a href=\"https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional\">其他安全选项</a>部分进行添加。</p>\n<h2 id=\"openpgp\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#openpgp\">#</a> OpenPGP</h2>\n<p>这部分可以算是 Canokey 最主要的应用场景，关于 OpenPGP 的具体介绍就不在这里展开了，可以参考 <a href=\"https://ulyc.github.io/2021/01/13/2021%E5%B9%B4-%E7%94%A8%E6%9B%B4%E7%8E%B0%E4%BB%A3%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8PGP-%E4%B8%8A/\">2021年，用更现代的方法使用 PGP</a>

第一章：被遗弃的自由主义</h2>\n<p>人类文明之河正在逆转，不再流往我们期望的自由和繁荣，而是通往奴役和苦难。这令我们困惑不已：我们不是已经全力奔往光明了吗？我们不是一直在努力使这个世界更美好吗？为何结果与愿望如此大相径庭？</p>\n<p>罪魁祸首究竟是谁？有人归咎于无良的资本家，有人归咎于某个邪恶的国家，还有人归咎于我们与之斗争了半个世纪的社会制度。我们能接受各种理由，唯独不肯承认这场危机的脓头就长在我们自己身上：<strong>正是我们的某些理想，带来了截然相反的结果</strong>。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1\">#</a> 1</h3>\n<p>今天，身披自由和极权两种战袍的国家正在殊死搏斗。但把视线放到战争以前，就会看到，这些对立的思想一起在欧洲文明中孕育。那时，文明就已危机四伏，自由、公正的价值理念都已饱受冲击，甚至在那些自由体制的国家里，也已涌现出对极权的狂热。</p>\n<p>即使这次我们赢得战争，也只是让我们再次回到思想的分岔路口，如果选不出正确的道路，又将重蹈覆辙。</p>\n<p>很难想象，德国、意大利、苏联竟然和我们的思想同根同源。真希望他们和我们完全不同啊，这样的话，他们那边发生的事情在我们这应该就不会发生了。然而，双方的不同之处其实很少。只是这些年在极权的浪潮下，他们的理念快速变化，才引发了无法调和的冲突。</p>\n<p>过去的 25 年里，思想和社会秩序发生了方向性的改变，欧洲文明一步步地偏离它的根本理念。我们满怀希望积极推动的变革，一步步地把我们带到了恐怖的极权主义面前。</p>\n<p>我们已经逐步放弃了经济的自由。尽管过去的经验表明，<strong>没有经济的自由也不会有个人自由和政治自由</strong>。</p>\n<p>十九世纪最伟大的政治思想家托克维尔和阿克顿勋爵曾说，社会主义意味着奴役。但我们完全没有意识到这两者之间的关联。我们把先哲的警告抛到脑后，朝着社会主义的方向稳步前进。现在，一种新的奴役形式已经出现在眼前。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>穿过十九世纪，透视更长的历史就会清晰地看到，往社会主义的转向，完全背离了西方文明的进程。</p>\n<p>我们背离了科布登和布莱特，背离了亚当斯密和休谟，背离了洛克和弥尔顿。我们不仅放弃了十八、十九世纪的自由主义，还放弃了从伊拉斯谟和蒙田、西塞罗和塔西佗、伯里克利和修昔底德那里继承来的个人主义。</p>\n<p>今天，大家总把个人主义和自私自利联系在一起，这是彻底的误解。<strong>个人主义的基本特点是尊重个人，尊重个体差异化的想法和品味，它的对立面是集体主义</strong>。</p>\n<p><strong>“宽容”是形容个人主义最贴切的词</strong>，在宽容的社会制度下，每个人都可以选择自己的生活方式。但是，在极权国家兴起之后，宽容就日渐消亡了。</p>\n<p>纳粹头领说，国家社会主义是反文艺复兴的。的确如此。因为文艺复兴运动，复兴的就是古典文明里的个人主义。古典哲学和基督教里都含有个人主义的要素，文艺复兴重新点燃了这些要素，使其成长为西方文明的重要组成部分。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>过去，个人主义的发展和商业的发展密切关联。从意大利北部的商业城市开始，个人主义随着商业往西部、北部传播，途经法国和德国西南部，抵达低地国家和英伦三岛。在没有专制统治的地方，个人主义便落地生根，成为国家政治生活的基础。之后，它又继续扩张，向西传到美洲新大陆，向东传到欧洲中部。</p>\n<p>欧洲近代历史里，社会发展的总体方向，是把个人从陈规旧俗中解放出来。大家渐渐发现，每个个体的自发工作形成了整体的良好的社会经济秩序。随后，经济学家们认识到了经济自由的价值。由于经济自由源自对个人的解放，所以说，经济自由是政治自由带来的意外礼物。</p>\n<p><strong>自由主义的基本原则是：尽量多让社会自发，尽量少用强制力</strong>。让人们主动去创建一种制度，而不是让人们被动接受一种制度。自由主义希望解放个体，让大家自由发展和竞争。</p>\n<p>解放个体带来的最大益处，可能要数科学的大发展。以前，主流思想禁锢了新知识的产生，主流的是非观念阻碍了个人的创新探索。后来，随着个人自由的扩张，科学才得以大踏步前进，在近 150 年里使世界大变样。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>19  世纪的极权主义者孔德说：西方文明的长年病根，就在于个人对集体的反叛。是的，个人主义的确是建造西方文明的根本力量。个人主义使人们认识到自由的重要性，只要解开集体捆绑在个人身上的锁链，社会便会迅速发展。就像过去两百年里发生的，在个人主义的推动下，人类的物质文明高歌猛进，惠及所有社会阶层。</p>\n<p>随着认知水平的提升，人们开始看到个人主义的瑕疵，而且不愿宽容这些瑕疵。但是，只拿瑕疵来评价个人主义，是典型的一叶障目不见泰山。毫无疑问，个人主义的成就远超出人们的期望。到二十世纪初，西方世界的普通劳工就能享有一定程度的舒适、安全、独立的生活了。在 100 年之前，这是不可想象的。</p>\n<p>已经取得的成就让人们信心大涨，开始相信自己有能力掌控人类的命运，开始嫌进步的速度不够快。越来越多人认为，过去推动社会进步的自由主义，现在成了进步的障碍。他们觉得，要想进一步发展，唯一的办法就是重新塑造社会。</p>\n<p><strong>很少有人考虑怎样改进，大家关心的是打碎重来</strong>。就像只热衷于全新事物的年轻人一样，人们对于深入了解当前社会缺乏耐心和兴趣。</p>\n<p>我们对社会的态度彻底地改变了，完全背离了自由发展的趋势，完全放弃了创造出西方文明的个人主义传统。我们不再尊重社会自发的力量，而是想要消除市场机制、废弃个人主义，力图将社会力量集体化，以实现宏大的计划。美其名曰：为自由而计划。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>在过去的两百年间，英国的思想曾往东方蓬勃扩展，自由法则仿佛要造福全球。然而，从 1870  年开始，英国在政治和社会领域不再领先，英国思想的影响力开始衰竭。之后的六十年里，德国成了世界的中心。它在物质文明领域取得了巨大的进步，并且涌现出众多广受赞誉的思想家和科学家。</p>\n<p>早在纳粹兴起以前，德国人就蔑视以自由主义、民主政治、个人主义、自由贸易等为内涵的欧洲文明。他们认为个人主义不过是为自私自利辩护，而自由贸易则不过是英国人敛财的幌子。</p>\n<p>德国的思想开始往东西扩张，似乎要统治二十世纪的思想界。无论是黑格尔还是马克思，无论是李斯特还是施穆勒，无论是桑巴特还是曼海姆，无论是激进的社会主义还是温和的“计划”，德国的思想广受欢迎，德国的社会制度也四处被模仿。</p>\n<p>社会主义虽然并非源于德国，但也是在德国完成的。德国曾在社会主义的发展上起了重要的领导作用，但我们很多人居然都不记得了。如今，德国把社会主义当成敌人，但在上一代，社会主义思想弥漫整个德奥，德国议会里甚至有一个巨大的社会主义党。</p>\n<p>今天，无论苏联还是英美的社会主义者，他们只是拾德国人的牙慧，他们谈的问题早就被德国社会主义者谈烂了。</p>\n<h2 id=\"第二章伟大的乌托邦\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#第二章伟大的乌托邦\">#</a> 第二章：伟大的乌托邦</h2>\n<p>把人间变成地狱的，正是对天堂的向往。——F·荷尔德林</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-2\">#</a> 1</h3>\n<p>今天，社会主义已经取代自由主义成为多数进步人士的追求。人们已经遗忘它诞生时鲜明的独裁特征。那时它被认为是自由最大的敌人，如今却在自由的旗帜下被拥抱。</p>\n<p>奠定现代社会主义基石的法国作家们，都坚定地认为，他们的主张必须靠强大的独裁政府来推行，要用强迫的手段改造社会，把社会按照阶级进行分层组织和管制，并强制统一思想。他们把思想自由看作万恶之源，现代计划主义第一人圣西门甚至说，对于不服从者将“给予畜牲的待遇”。</p>\n<p>法国政治家托克维尔早就意识到，社会主义和民主政治之间无法调和，因为它们对个人自由的态度截然相反。托克维尔说：“民主制度扩大个人自由的范围，社会主义则限制个人自由的范围；前者把一切可能的价值赋予个人，后者则把个人当作一个工具、一个数字；表面上两者都主张平等，但是，前者在自由里求平等，后者在奴役里求平等。”</p>\n<h3

id=\"3-2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-2\">#</a>

1933 年之前的德国，以及 1922 年之前的意大利，表面上看起来，共产党跟纳粹或法西斯的斗争确实比跟其他党派频繁，但背后的原因是他们在争抢同种思维模式的人。毫不奇怪，他们彼此都把对方当作潜在的招募对象，都认为对方是被异端邪说蛊惑了的好材料。</p>\n<p>很多法西斯和纳粹的头领一开始是社会主义者，后来变成法西斯分子和纳粹分子。比如墨索里尼、赖伐尔和吉斯林。下层的普通成员里，有这样经历的人就更多了。在德国，众所周知，一个年轻的共产主义者变成一个纳粹分子，或者反过来，都是相当容易的。他们真正的敌人是那些老式的自由主义者，他们与这些人毫无共同之处，也完全没办法说服这些人。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-2\">#</a>

id=\"第三章社会主义-计划机制和自由主义\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#第三章社会主义-计划机制和自由主义\">#</a> 第三章：社会主义、计划机制和自由主义</h2>\n<p>社会主义者信仰两种截然不同甚至也许相互矛盾的东西：自由和组织。——埃利·阿列维</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-3\">#</a> 1</h3>\n<p>在讨论之前，我们先来澄清社会主义这个概念。</p>\n<p>社会主义这个词包含着两重涵义：首先，它代表一些理想目标，如社会正义、更大平等和保障等（相当于“世界大同”，译者注）。其次，对大部分社会主义者而言，“社会主义”也意味着为了“世界大同”所必须采用的、特定甚至唯一的方法，即废除私有企业、废除生产资料私有制、创造“计划经济”、用中央计划机构取代企业家等。</p>\n<p>很多人自称为社会主义者，但实际上他们只是认同“世界大同”这个理想目标，并不理解或关心这些目标到底如何实现，以及需要付出什么代价。但是，社会主义目标的实现方法和目标本身一样重要。很多反对社会主义的人，对它的理想目标是认同的，所担心的是目标的实现方法将对其它价值造成伤害。因此，<strong>关于社会主义的争论主要是它的实现方法导致的，而不是它的“世界大同”理想导致的</strong>。</p>\n<p>令情况更复杂的是，作为社会主义改革主要手段的“经济计划”，可以被用于许多其它目的。把好东西分配给某些特定群体（某个种族、某些党派成员、贵族阶级）和为了实现我们心中的正义而采用的平均分配，就方法本身而言是一模一样的。</p>\n<p>考虑到上述情况，为了避免概念混淆，也许应该把社会主义目标的实现方法称为集体主义。社会主义者和自由主义者之间的争论，主要是关于这种集体主义的方法的争论，而不是关于世界大同的目标的争论。本书中提及的一切相应后果，也都源于集体主义的方法，与社会主义的目标没有关系。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-3\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>另一个需要特别澄清的概念是“计划机制”。“计划机制”之所以能打动人心，很大程度是由于“计划”这个词涵义的模糊性。</p>\n<p>我们通常说的计划，是指每个人利用自己的预见，尽可能理性地处理问题。人人都是计划者，按照自己的计划开展着各自的活动。但是，这并不是社会主义者所说的计划，社会主义者要求的是：根据一个单一的计划指导一切经济活动，管理所有社会资源，以便达成特定的目标。本章将使用“计划机制”来描述这一概念，以便区别于我们通常说的计划。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-3\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>还需要避免混淆“自由主义”和自由放任。</p>\n<p>自由主义主张尽量用竞争机制来协调人类的各种努力，而不是让事态放任自流。自由主义相信有效的竞争是指导个人努力的最好方法。自由主义不否认，甚至强调，为了竞争能有益地运行，需要一种精心设想的法律框架。自由主义也不否认，无法创造出有效竞争时需要用其它方法指导经济活动。</p>\n<p>但是，自由主义反对用其它缺陷更大的方法来替代竞争机制，不仅因为竞争在大多数情况下都是最有效率的方法，而且因为竞争是唯一的、不依靠当局的强制或干预就可以协调我们各类活动的方法。<strong>这就是竞争的一大优势——不再需要“有意识的社会控制”</strong>。</p>\n<p>用竞争来对社会进行组织，能够免除很多对经济生活的强制干预，但竞争也允许某些干预发挥作用，甚至会要求政府争取特定行动。</p>\n<p>为什么要强调尽可能减少干预呢？因为，只有人们能够自由地生产、买卖任何有可能被生产和买卖的东西，只有行业进入的机会向所有各方平等开放，竞争才能持续有效。任何控制特定商品的价格或数量的企图，都会使竞争无法有效地协调个人的行动，因为这时价格的变化不再能体现市场环境的变化，无法为个人的行动提供可靠的指南。</p>\n<p>有些措施只是在规定哪些生产方法可被使用，只要它对所有潜在的生产者都产生同样的影响，而且它的目的并不是为了控制价格和产量，那么，尽管会增加成本或投入，这些措施还是值得采用的。例如禁止使用某种有毒物质、限制工作时长和要求提供某种卫生设施等，这些措施与维持竞争完全兼容。在这种情况下，需要考虑的是，这些措施带来的社会利益是否大于产生的社会成本。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-3\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>令人遗憾的是，迄今为止，大家更关注的是如何减少对竞争的干预，而非如何创造竞争运行的条件。</p>\n<p>竞争机制要能正常运行，不仅需要足够的诸如货币、市场、信息渠道这些私人企业很难提供的基础工具，还需要既能维护竞争，又能使竞争尽量发挥正面作用的法律体系。光是承认私有产权和契约自由是远远不够的，还需要用法律体系对不同事物的产权进行精确界定。</p>\n<p>法律制度如何才能让竞争体系运行得更有效率？我们对这个问题缺乏系统研究。另外，公司法、专利法方面的缺失，不仅使竞争低效，甚至在有些领域已经摧毁了竞争。</p>\n<p>的确存在一些领域，由于无法使所有者从其财产或提供的服务中获取收益或承担损失，以致于无法通过法律创造出可行的私有产权和市场竞争体系。在这些领域里，必须使用竞争以外的方式来提供服务。</p>\n<p>例如，在道路上设置路标甚至道路本身的费用，无法由使用者单独付费；砍伐森林、某些耕种方法或者工厂的烟尘噪音造成的损害，也无法限定为只由财产所有者承担，或通过自愿协议补偿受害人。在这种情况下，我们必须寻找竞争机制以外的替代方案。但在那些竞争能够发挥作用的地方，则不应压制竞争。</p>\n<p>创造条件使竞争尽可能有效、在竞争不能行之有效的地方加以补充、提供市场方式无法提供的那些服务（正如亚当斯密所说，这些服务“虽然有利于社会，但是服务者将入不敷出”），这些任务已经足够为国家提供宽广、无可争议且应当作为的活动空间了。</p>\n<p><strong>有效的竞争体系和其它体系一样，需要精心设计和持续调整的法律框架</strong>。即便那些使竞争能够运行的最基础的条件，如防止欺诈或欺骗（包括利用无知而剥削），都给立法活动提供了伟大且远未达成的目标。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-2\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>然而，尽管在创造出能让竞争制度良性运行的合适框架方面还有大量工作需要完成，很多国家的政府却已掉转方向，不再努力使竞争得以运行和加以补充，而是试图用一些完全不同且无法调和的原则来替代竞争。</p>\n<p>还有一些社会主义者，出于对集中计划可能消灭自由的恐惧，想象出一种“竞争性社会主义“，希望把废除私有财产和保留个人自由两者融合起来。但这种想法有着内在矛盾，控制所有生产资源而不决定这些资源将为谁和由谁来使用，这是不可想象的。融合体系下，竞争将只是一种摆设。</p>\n<p>在从自由竞争转向中央计划的过程中，还必将产生一种更坏的、中央计划者和自由主义者都不满意的形态：无政府的工团组织。在这种组织中，竞争已经被压制了，而计划则由各个产业中相互独立的垄断者制定。由于人们只是因憎恨竞争而联合起来，但对该做什么却没有一致意见，出现这种形态是必然的。</p>\n<p>随着一个行业接一个行业中的竞争被破坏，消费者只得听任那些组织得更好的行业里的资本家和工人联合垄断的摆布。一旦到了这种阶段，除了回复到竞争外，唯一的替代办法就是由国家来实施越来越严密和完全的垄断。</p>\n<p>英国现在正在迅速接近这个阶段，而且因为战争大大加速了。随着时间的推移，各种严重问题和危险将会越来越明显。</p>\n<p>大多数人对“集中管理经济活动”这一理念仍然感到惊骇，不仅是因为这项任务非常困难，而且因为每一件事都要由一个独一无二的中心来加以指导的想法本身就令人恐惧。但我们实际上正在向这种状况快速前进，因为很多人幻想能在“原子级别“的自由竞争和集中管理之间找到中间道路。这种中间道路的幻想貌似合理，非常容易打动明白事理的人们。</p>\n<p>然而我们要明白，尽管竞争制度能容忍一定程度的管制，但一旦和集中计划融合，竞争就再也无法继续有效地指导生产了。况且，“集中计划”也不是一种可以小剂量服用就能生效的药剂。竞争和集中计划二者如果是不完全的，都将成为拙劣且无效的工具。两者如果混合起来使用，其结果反而比始终只取其一还要糟糕。</p>\n<p>换句话说：<strong>只有在为竞争而计划，而不是运用计划反对竞争的时候，计划和竞争才能够结合起来</strong>。</p>\n<h2 id=\"第四章计划机制真的不可避免吗\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#第四章计划机制真的不可避免吗\">#</a> 第四章：计划机制真的不可避免吗？</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-4\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-4\">#</a> 1</h3>\n<p>大部分计划者都觉得计划机制并非心中所愿，但他们相信计划取代竞争的趋势不可避免。这种“计划机制不可避免”的笃信缺乏证据支撑，向垄断和计划机制的发展并不是什么我们无法控制的客观因素导致的，它是半个世纪以来，相关观点不断发酵传播并主导了我们政策制定的结果。</p>\n<p>对“计划机制不可避免”最常见的论述是：技术进步导致越来越多的领域无法开展竞争，人们只能在私人垄断和政府计划之间做两难选择。这种信念的主要来源是马克思主义关于”产业集中化“的学说。</p>\n<p>过去五十年垄断持续增长，越来越多领域竞争受限，这的确是事实。但最重要的问题是，垄断增长到底是技术进步的后果，还是国家政策的后果？从垄断增长的实际过程不难看出，政策导致垄断的可能性更大。</p>\n<p>“技术进步导致垄断增长”的论证逻辑是：在现代化大生产条件下，大企业相对小企业的效率优势越来越明显，它的单位生产成本不断递减，导致小企业无法生存，最终只剩下少数巨头。</p>\n<p>这种看法太片面，没有注意到技术进步带来的多维度变化，也缺乏严肃的实证研究支持。我们目前能获得的最好的证据，是美国“全国经济临时委员会”这家显然没有自由主义偏好的机构对“经济力量集中化”的研究。这份基于广泛事实研究的报告指出：“现有的任何证据都很难得出”高效率的大规模生产将导致竞争消失的观点。</p>\n<p>原文摘要如下：</p>\n<p><em>“……大企业的高效率并未得到证明……规模经济即使存在，也不必然导致垄断……效率最高的生产规模，在远未形成垄断时就能达成。大规模生产的有利条件并不必然导致竞争消失。反而应当注意到，促使垄断形成的往往并非大规模低成本生产，而是共谋协议和公共政策。一旦这些协议失效和政策反转，竞争条件就能够被修复。”</em></p>\n<p>对英国进行类似的调查会得到相似的结果。如果你注意到垄断者为了维持其有效控制，会如何热心、频繁地寻求国家权力的帮助，你就绝不会相信垄断的形成是不可避免的。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-4\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-4\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>如果技术进步或资本主义演化必然产生垄断的话，垄断应该首先在最发达的经济体内出现。但实际上，垄断最早出现在美国和德国这样相对年轻的工业国家。</p>\n<p>在被看成资本主义发展过程典型的德国，卡特尔和辛迪加这样的垄断组织，是从 1878  年之后在有意识的系统政策扶植下才发展起来的。政府不仅出台了保护政策，甚至用了强制手段，催生出管制价格和销售的垄断组织。在德国政府的帮助下，“科学规划”和“工业自觉组织”等社会实验得以实施，并导致了巨型垄断组织的出现。在美国，同样是高度保护性的政策导致了类似垄断的出现。</p>\n<p>英国在 1931  年实施普遍保护政策后的变化，也清楚表明垄断更多是政策实施的结果。在此之前，除了少数受保护的行业，英国的整体经济还是充分竞争的，至少在 1929  年前，就业和一般经济活动都还保持良好。但在普遍保护政策实施后，垄断就以惊人的速度增长，并使英国工业变化到了公众几乎无法了解的程度。</p>\n<p>德国为了实现计划机制的理想千方百计地遏制竞争，他们正沿着 19 世纪思想家们（尤其是德国思想家，如桑巴特）设计的路线图，向完全计划社会前进。过去 60 年或 80 年思想发展史充分说明，<strong>在社会演化中，没有什么东西是不可避免的，使其成为不可避免的是思想</strong>。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-4\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-4\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>“技术进步导致计划不可避免”的另一种解释是：现代工业文明的复杂性带来了一些新问题，这些问题只有通过集中计划才能解决。不可否定，有些问题（例如现代城市的公用事业问题）在竞争机制下未能充分解决，但要求中央计划的那些人心目中，“公用事业”这类问题并不是最重要的。他们所建议的是，由于越来越难清晰地了解完整的经济过程，需要由某种中央机构来协调才能避免社会生活在混乱中解体。</p>\n<p>这些人完全没有理解竞争的作用。<strong>恰恰是由于现代劳动分工足够复杂，才使竞争成为唯一能实现充分协调的手段</strong>。如果条件简单到一个人或一个机构都能了解所有相关事实的话，进行控制或计划就没什么困难了。正是由于需要考虑的因素多不胜数，无法获取全景概括，去中心化才变得不可避免。没有任何人能够有意识地平衡诸多独立个体决策时所要考虑的因素，所以无法用某种“有意识的控制”进行协调。</p>\n<p>没有任何中心可以完全了解、及时搜集和反馈影响各种商品供求关系的变化细节，所以必须要有某种机制能够自动记录所有个体行动的相关后果。这些后果既是每个个体的决策导致的，又指引着每个个体的决策。这正是价格机制在竞争环境下起的作用，没有其它任何系统能达成哪怕只是近似的效果。</p>\n<p>价格机制使企业家只需要像工程师注视仪表盘那样，靠观察少数价格的变动，就足以调整自己的行动。<strong>整体越复杂，我们就越需要依靠价格体系这种非人为的机制来传递分散在个体中的知识并协调行动</strong>。如果依赖笨拙、原始和容量有限的有意识中央计划的话，我们的工业体系永远发展不到今天这样高度的差异化、复杂度和灵活性。</p>\n<p>要注意的是，价格机制只能在充分竞争的环境下起作用。我们的分工能达到现代文明所需要的如此精细的程度，是由于它超过了人类有意识创造的能力，是人们无意中摸索出来的。分工的进一步发展，只会使我们更需要某种不依赖有意识控制的机制。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-4\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-4\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>还有一种观点认为，竞争会阻碍技术的进步，只有在垄断的保护下，新技术才能发展起来。这种说法并非毫无道理。例如，如果所有英国人都开同一种汽车，也许英国能生产出比美国更好更便宜的汽车；如果所有人都只使用电力的话，也许电力会比煤炭或煤气更便宜。通过强制的标准化或限制过多的选择，我们在某些领域生产效率的提升也许足以补偿消费者选择受限的损失，某些新发明也可能因此更快普及。</p>\n<p>但是，我们所付出的短期代价，是为了在未来能享有更多选择。即使某些发明能给我们巨大的力量，但为此就要破坏我们最宝贵的遗产——自由，也是十分荒谬的。如果我们希望保全自由，就必须比任何时候都更为珍惜它，并愿意为此作出牺牲。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-3\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-3\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>既然没有客观事实逼迫我们走向计划机制，那为什么技术专家中支持计划机制的比例如此之高呢？</p>\n<p>要知道：几乎每个技术专家的理想，如果能入选为人类社会的单一目标的话，都是相对容易实现的。世界上有无数我们认为既值得追求又有实现可能的美好事物，但哪怕我们付出毕生努力通常也只能实现少数几个。</p>\n<p>正是由于在自己领域里的梦想经常受阻，专家们才转而支持计划机制，希望把自己关心的事纳入整体计划。他们不愿跳出自己的专业背景和眼前利益，花费脑力去理解为什么这些好事情无法同时实施，为什么达成其中一项往往意味着要牺牲掉其它好几项。</p>\n<p>的确，在一些计划/半计划国家里，我们能看到计划机制的成功案例，耳熟能详的是德国和意大利的高速公路。但是，特定领域的技术成就并不能证明计划体制的整体优越性，某些和整体条件并不相称的极端技术成就，反倒是资源错配的证明。如果你在著名的德国高速公路上开过车，你就会注意到，这些路上的车流量还不如英国的很多二级公路。</p>\n<p>很多专家幻想他们所关心的项目在计划机制下能得到更多支持。我们每个人都会觉得自己个人的价值排序不仅仅适用于我们自己，只要和我们讨论的人足够“理性”，我们就能说服他们支持我们的价值排序。</p>\n<p>喜欢田园风光的人希望能够保持传统风貌去除那些现代工业造成的“噪点”，热衷健康的人却偏偏希望清理掉那些风景如画但卫生状况可疑的古老茅屋；迷信效率的人执着于最大程度的专业化和机械化，理想主义者为了发展个性却渴望尽可能保留独立工匠……</p>\n<p>这些人都知道他们的目标只有通过计划体制才能实现，因此支持计划体制。不过，如果计划体制真的能够运行，这些目标之间隐藏的冲突就会暴露无遗。</p>\n<p>“向计划体制转变”的思潮如此有力，也因为它吸引了很多单一思维的理想主义者。他们献身于某种单一的任务，并容易夸大这个任务的社会价值。他们对计划体制所寄予的期望，往往是对社会片面观察的结果。</p>\n<p>我并非要贬低理想主义者的价值，他们非常值得尊敬。但正是这些值得尊敬、渴望对社会进行计划的人，如果得到允许，他们将成为最危险的人和最不能容忍别人计划的人。<strong>从圣洁的、单一思维的理想主义者到狂热分子往往只有一步之遥</strong>。如果让世界上每个领域最著名的专家毫无阻碍地去实现他们的理想，那就再没有比这个更难忍受和更不合理的世界了。</p>\n<h2 id=\"第五章计划与民主\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#第五章计划与民主\">#</a> 第五章：计划与民主</h2>\n<p>有的政治家试图指导每个人使用自己的资本，这不但是瞎操心，而且是越权。这样的权力就算交给议会都令人不放心。如果一个自认为有这种能力的愚蠢狂妄之徒掌握了这种权力，那就危险到极点了。——亚当·斯密</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-5\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-5\">#</a> 1</h3>\n<p>所有的集体主义组织，都是为了一个明确的社会目标而被精心构筑起来的社会劳动者组织。集体主义和个人自由主义冲突的关键是：集体主义者们想要组织全部资源实现统一的社会目标，他们拒绝承认存在个人至上的领域。集体主义者认为，如果社会缺少有目标有意识的指导，就会被一个个冲动的、自我的、没有责任感的个人所左右。</p>\n<p>社会目标通常被表达为模糊的“公共利益”、“普遍福祉”或者“共同利益”，但这些名词没有明确的定义，无法决定具体的行动方向。</p>\n<p>千百万人的福利是无法界定的各种因素的组合，每个人的每种需求都要占据一席之地。如果要根据一个单一的计划指导人们的所有行动，就需要一个十分完整的价值序列和道德准则。如果使用所有的社会财产来推进某个单一的计划，就必定需要一个可以指导一切的道德准则。但这样的道德准则根本不存在，人们总是在不同的价值之间选来选去，没有理由也没有必要对人们“应该干什么”规定标准答案。</p>\n<p>随着文明发展，以道德名义束缚个人行为的陈规旧忌越来越少，个人自由的范围越来越大。任何详细的道德准则或单一的经济计划都与历史趋势背道而驰。</p>\n<p>没有可以包罗万象的标尺，也没有可以了解所有需求并权衡轻重的智者。任何人只能考察有限的领域，认识有限的需求。每个人的价值尺度都是局部的、相互不同甚至矛盾的。基于这个毫无争议的事实，个人主义主张在特定的范围内允许个人遵循自己而不是他人的价值偏好行事。在这个特定范围内，个人的目标是至高无上的，无须屈从于他人的任何指令。个人主义的立场实质就是：承认个人是其目标的最终决断者，个人可以按自己的意图支配行动。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-5\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-5\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>认可个人主义并不代表不认可社会目标。人们会因为一些目标联合起来，社会目标不过是个人为了满足自身欲望所接受的共同目标。但共同目标不是个人的终极目标，只是个人为了实现自身目的而使用的手段，人们只是对于这个手段而不是终极目标更容易达成共识。共同行动应当仅限于人们一致同意的领域。</p>\n<p>当人们联合起来时，就把他们的目标赋予了像国家这样的组织，但赋予的目标有其特定和有限的领域，仅在这个领域中它才是至高无上的。领域越大，人们达成一致的可能性越小。如果无限地扩大公共行动领域，则必然伤及个人在自己领域里的自由。一旦国家控制的公共部分超过了一定限度，国家行为就会支配整个体系，导致每个人的目标都需要依赖于国家行动才能实现。</p>\n<p>计划机制的目标会被冠以“共同福利”这样的称呼，这是对缺乏真正一致性的掩饰。但当要把单一计划转换为一个个具体计划时，这种不一致性就会暴露出来。人们同意要有一个中心计划，但是在目标上却达不成一致，就像一群人决定一起旅行，但是在要去的地点上达不成一致，结果他们全体不得不进行一次大多数人根本不想去的旅行。</p>\n<p>计划机制会造成这样一种景象，我们必须同意的任务将大大超出初始的意愿，因为我们无法把集体行为限定在我们同意的任务上，为了行动能够完全实施，我们不得不同意所有的事情。这决定了计划机制性质的最重要特点。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-5\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-5\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>人们认为议会应当拟定一个无所不包的经济计划，但这超出了议会的能力，由此引发了大家对民主制度的不满。于是人们相信，想要落实这样的计划，必须托付给专家（常设官员或者独立机构）。</p>\n<p>然而，议会效率低不是机构本身造成的，而是它所承担任务的内在矛盾，他们被要求对每件事情都取得一致意见，但计划是精心设计的相互适应的复杂整体，通过各种冲突妥协而达成一致的可能性远远小于成功筹划一次军事战役。</p>\n<p>军事任务的确可以托付给专家，这是因为负责一场战役的将军受托的是一个单一目标，战争期间由他所控制的所有手段都专注于这个目标。而制定经济计划时却无法设定这样的单一目标，必须要在种种相互冲突和相互竞争的目标（不同人的不同需求）之间进行选择，这正是经济问题的实质。在制定经济计划时，利益是如此不同以至于不可能在议会里达成一致。</p>\n<p>如果非要把制定经济计划的权力授予某个机构，那就意味着赋予了它运用法律力量进行专断的权力。这将成为民主政体逐渐放弃民主，走上计划道路的第一步。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-5\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-5\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>尽管如此，还是有越来越多的人认同计划的必要性，越来越多的人不满意民主议会的效率，人们希望把权力赋予政府或某些个人，以使他们能够解决问题。</p>\n<p>认为必须摆脱民主程序的羁绊才能有所作为的错误信念越来越流行。“召唤经济独裁者”是转向计划机制过程中的一个特有阶段。人们呼吁：“我们正生活在经济混乱中，只有在某种独裁领导下，我们才能摆脱这种混乱。”</p>\n<p>在 1933 年前的一段时间里，德国已经达到一个实质上不得不实行独裁统治的阶段。那时没有人怀疑民主已经破产。希特勒无须摧毁民主，他只是利用了民主的衰败，在紧要关头获得了许多人的支持。人们虽然憎恨希特勒，但却认为他是唯一一个足够坚强、能够有所作为的人。</p>\n<p>计划者有这样的论调：只要民主政体仍然保持最终的控制，民主的本质就不会受影响。他们认为，虽然越来越多的生活领域都屈从于国家的控制，但如果议会的最高权力能对一些控制加以防范的话，就能保住民主。</p>\n<p>这种乐观信念忽略了一个致命的问题：当议会无法对一个计划进行局部反对时，情况就完全不同了。只要遭到反对的局部被说成整体必不可少的部分，为了推进整体目标的达成，反对就会无效。整个制度将趋向于那种全民公决的独裁制。在这种制度下，政府首脑一次又一次通过人民投票巩固其地位，确保事情按他期望的方向进行。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-4\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-4\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>民主，就意味着必须把“有意识的控制”限定在真正一致的领域中，在其他领域则让事情自然发展。只有把政府的职能限定在那些多数人可能达成一致的领域，民主政府才能有效运行，一旦政府职能跨出这些领域，就会出现将少数人的意志强加给他人的现象。</p>\n<p>自由主义信条的最大优点就是把需要达成一致意见的领域缩到所需要的最小。现在人们常说要民主就不能要资本主义。但是，如果资本主义指的是私有产权基础上的竞争体制，那么只有在这种体制中，民主才有可能。倘若被集体信条统治，民主将不可避免地自行毁灭。</p>\n<p>我们无意将民主供为神灵，民主不是最高的政治目标，它本质上是一种保障内部安定和个人自由的实用手段。它绝不是一贯正确和可靠无疑的，当民主不关注对个人自由的保障时，它也可能造就极权政体。</p>\n<p>有一种错误观点认为，只要权力来源于多数人的意志，就不会专横。这种观点没意识到民主背后的极权危险。防止权力专断的方法，不是限制权力的来源，而是限制权力的使用。否则的话，如果民主制度决定了一项任务，这项任务又必定要使用无法约束的权力，这时专制就诞生了。</p>\n<h2

1</h3>\n<p>自由国家和专制国家的最大区别，是前者遵循着被称为法治的伟大原则。</p>\n<p><strong>法治，是指政府在一切行动中都受到事先规定并宣布的规则的约束</strong>。这种规则使人们可以十分肯定地预见到政府在某一情况中会怎样使用它的强制力，并据此规划自己的个人活动。尽管不完美，但法治的基本点很清楚：权力机构的自由应当减少到最低限度。</p>\n<p>虽然法律在一定程度上限制了个人的自由，但法治之下，个人可以在已知规则内自由地追求自己的目标，不会被政府权力阻挠。这些规则是事先制定的，它们并不针对特定的人，而是针对特定的行为。</p>\n<p>在自由主义时代，法治茁壮成长，并成为自由主义最伟大的成就之一。它不仅是自由的保障，也是自由在法律上的体现。正如康德所说：“<strong>如果一个人不需要服从任何人，只需要服从法律，那么他就是自由的</strong>。”</p>\n<h3

2</h3>\n<p>集体主义类型的经济计划必定会与法治背道而驰。因为计划机构不允许个人自由利用资源，也无法事先用规则来约束自己、防止专断。</p>\n<p>当人们的实际需求出现时，计划当局必须在这些需求之间做选择。它需要决定一些根据一般规则无法得到答案的问题，并在做决定时把人们分出尊卑轻重。</p>\n<p>例如，要决定饲养多少头猪、运营多少辆公共汽车、经营哪些煤矿、按什么价格出售鞋子，这些决定不可能从一般规则中推论出来，也不可能事先做出长期的规定。做这些决定时，政府往往必须权衡各种人和各个利益集团的利害关系，最终必须要有某个人来决定哪些人的利益比较重要。换句话说，政府给人们强加了一种新的等级差别。</p>\n<p>一个经济生活受到彻底管制的国家中，就算形式上承认个人权利，也没有意义。中欧各个国家的经验表明，政府完全可能运用一些公认的经济政策，来推行歧视少数民族的无情政策，同时又不违反保护少数民族权利的法规。像“由政府控制产业发展”这种表面上无关痛痒的原则，会为歧视和压迫政策提供横行无忌的通行证。</p>\n<p>事实表明，<strong>政府“计划”得越多，个人自由行动的空间就越小</strong>。</p>\n<p>因此，自由主义者主张政府只为经济活动订立一般规则，并听任个人自由行动。因为只有相关的个人才能充分地了解情况并采取行动。政府要想指导每个人的经济行动，它必须实时、完整地了解全部情况，实际上这根本无法做到。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-6\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-6\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p><strong>要理解法治，就要清楚形式规则和实体规则之间的区别，这一点非常重要</strong>。举个例子，前者指制定交通规则，后者指命令人们向何处去；前者指设置路标，后者指命令人们走哪条路。</p>\n<p>形式规则对事不对人，它告诉人们，在某种情况下政府将采取何种行动。这种规则用一般性的措辞来限定特定的行为，而不考虑时间、地点和特定的人。它所针对的是一种任何人都可能遇到的情况，我们事前无法知道谁会遇到这些情况。</p>\n<p>所以，形式规则不管控任何特定个人或群体。在热衷于控制一切的时代，形式规则看起来似乎显得软绵无力，然而它的伟大之处正在于此——它不管控特定的人，在它的面前人人平等。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-6\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-6\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>有人说，计划者能够凭借内心公平、合理的信念，以及在某一行业进行计划的经验，做到公平。但在特定问题上有直接利害关系的人，是当不好社会利益的裁判员的。例如某一行业里，劳资双方达成的限产协议解决了他们的利益分配问题，但那些对商品有需求的千百万消费者的利益就被损害了。</p>\n<p>计划机制下，当我们在“让儿童获得更多牛奶”和“让奶农获得更高价格”之间取舍时，当我们在“给工人更高的工资”和“让更多失业者就业”之间纠结时，都要借助一个完整的评价体系。<strong>随着越来越多具体的事件被纳入计划者的裁夺范围，计划的专断性越来越强，最终法律和司法将沦为政策的工具</strong>。这就是一部法治消亡的历史。希特勒上台前后，德国法治的消亡过程就是这样的。</p>\n<p>计划机制，必然要对不同的人的具体需求进行差别对待，禁止一个人做的事情同时又允许另一个人做。通过法律规定一部分人应当如何致富、不同人应当有什么和做什么，这实际上是回到了“身份统治”的局面，是社会的退步。</p>\n<p>亨利·梅恩爵士有句名言：“<strong>从身份到契约是一次伟大的进步</strong>。” 法治是人治的对立面，是和专制政治对立的武器。只有推行形式规则意义上的法治，消除实体规则保护的特定人物的特权，才能实现法律面前人人平等。</p>\n<p>“特权”的概念经常被滥用，土地只能由贵族所有是一种特权，政府把某些商品的生产和售卖权指定给某些人也是一种特权，但是人们拥有私有财产并不是“特权”。因为私有财产是任何人根据同样的规则都能获得的，不能因为某些人在取得私有财产方面比较成功，就把私有财产称作特权。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-5\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-5\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>有一种观念认为：只要政府的一切行动都经过立法机关授权，法治就能保持，这完全是对“法治”的误解。</p>\n<p>政府的行为经过立法机关的授权，这看起来在法律意义上合法了，但是不一定符合法治。希特勒是以严格符合宪法的方式获得无限权力的，但谁能说德国盛行法治呢？只要法律规定当局可以为所欲为，那么当局做的任何事就都是合法的，但这肯定不符合法治原则。</p>\n<p>通过立法赋予当局无限制的权力，这种主张部分源于人民主权论和民主政体论。用这种做法，可以把最专断的统治合法化。就这样，在一个民主制度下建立起了最彻底的专制。</p>\n<p>要想避免这种噩梦，就要正确理解法治。<strong>法治要求限制立法的范围，把范围限于公认的一般规则之下，拒绝为了特定人物的差别待遇而立法</strong>。</p>\n<h3 id=\"6\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#6\">#</a> 6</h3>\n<p>对立法权力的限制，意味着承认个人有不可让渡的权利，也意味着承认个人有不可侵犯的人权。</p>\n<p>一些人鼓吹集中计划的同时又为人权辩护，这是自相矛盾的。保留个人权利，不可避免地会阻碍集中计划的实施。“人权宣言”条文里，如果附加许多保留和限制，将使它失去重要意义。</p>\n<p>一边宣称“每个人有权买卖任何可以合法买卖之物”，可是又加上“只能买卖这么多的数量，并以符合公共利益为限”，这将使整个规定失效；一边宣称“每一个人可以从事任何合法的职业”，同时又规定他只能选择“对他开放的职业”，这也和自由选择职业背道而驰。</p>\n<p>当通讯手段和货币都受到管制，而且工业也要由计划配置时，怎样才能确保“旅行与迁居自由”呢？如果纸张的供应以及所有发行渠道都被控制，又怎样确保新闻自由呢？</p>\n<p>自从社会主义运动诞生以来，主张集体计划的社会主义者们，一直攻击个人权利优先的观念，他们认为社会中“没有个人权利只有个人义务”。</p>\n<p>今天，人们对于个人权利的意识日益淡薄，个人权利时常被粗暴侵犯。战时，人们甚至连公开批评的权利都被限制。在特殊时期临时这么做可能不可避免，但如果作为永久性的制度，就背离了法治原则，这将直接导致极权主义国家的建立。</p>\n<h2

1</h3>\n<p>一种流行的观点认为：计划机制必须或多或少地走极权路线。一个复杂体系，必须由一批专家来领导，最终的责任和权力必须掌握在领导者手中，其行为不应该受民主流程的限制。</p>\n<p>持这种观点的人还安慰大家说，这种极权主义的管理将仅仅用于经济事务领域。在这个领域放弃自由，就会在有更高价值的领域获得更多的自由。</p>\n<p>这种看似有吸引力的说法并不正确，它以为存在一些单纯的经济目标，这些目标与生活的其它目标毫无关系。实际上，严格来说并没有什么单纯的“经济目标”，经济只是我们追求其他目标的因素。有理性的人都不会以经济目标作为他们的最终目标。如果人们追求财富，那是因为财富能给人们广泛的选择机会，去享受他们努力的成果。</p>\n<p>在现代社会中，每个人的收入都是有限的，我们总能感受到收入不足带给生活的种种束缚。许多人因此憎恨这种束缚的代表——金钱，这当然不对。实际上，<strong>金钱是人类发明的最伟大的自由工具之一。正是通过金钱，无权无势的普通人也能够在各种商品和服务之间自由选择</strong>。</p>\n<p>许多社会主义者主张用各种“非经济激励”来代替“金钱激励”，不再用金钱的形式支付劳动报酬，而是用荣誉、特权、住宅、食物、旅行和受教育的机会等。这将大大损害劳动者的自由，原本他可以用金钱报酬自由地去换取想要的商品和服务。这样做的话，决定报酬的那个人，不仅决定了报酬的大小，还限定了报酬的形式。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-7\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-7\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>如前所述，根本不存在什么单纯的经济目标，我们经济上的得失都将影响我们生活上的需求。这一点，在自由选择的经济环境中可以看得很清楚。</p>\n<p>在自由的环境中，我们可以自行决定什么对我们重要，什么对我们次要。每当经济上有所损失时，我们总是先克制自己认为最不重要的那部分需求，以尽量减小经济问题对生活的影响。</p>\n<p>然而，在计划机制下，计划者不仅定义了不同目标的相对重要性，实际上还定义了人们不同需求的相对重要性，他决定了什么对我们更重要，什么不那么重要，我们的哪些需求值得被满足，哪些不那么值得。洞察这一点非常关键。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-7\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-7\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>只要计划者还控制着生产，就算不控制消费，也不会减弱计划者对个人生活的控制力。因为，控制了生产就控制了消费的源头。</p>\n<p>在一个自由竞争的社会里，如果一个人拒绝我们的交易需求，我们可以转向另一个人。但是，当我们面对计划机制下的垄断者时，我们将不得不对他唯命是从。可以想象，控制整个经济体系的计划者将是一个多么强大的垄断者。它有彻底的权利来决定给我们什么、按照什么条件。它能够决定商品、劳务在各个地区和集团之间的分配，也能够在人们之间推行任何程度的差别待遇。</p>\n<p>计划机制下，计划者并不仅仅控制着我们的消费，更重要的是控制着我们的生产。对于我们大多数人来说，我们生命的大部分时间都花在工作上，我们的职业通常决定了我们的生活地点、生活伙伴。因此，对于我们的幸福来说，择业的自由可能比闲暇时的消费自由更重要。</p>\n<p>诚然，即使在最好的社会中，择业的自由也是有限的。但重要的是我们确实拥有选择权。如果某一职位变得令人十分难以忍受，或者我们钟情于另一种工作，能干的人几乎总会有途径可以达到他的目的。就算处境十分艰难，只要知道努力奋斗就能改变处境，我们也能心存希望。但是，如果无论如何努力也不能使情况有所改变，那么人们将感到绝望。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-7\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-7\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>大多数计划者都承诺，会保障甚至还会增加择业的自由。但是这个承诺是无法兑现的。如果要进行计划，他们就必须控制各种行业和职业的入口，或者控制报酬条件，甚至两者都控制。几乎在所有已知的计划案例中，上述这些控制总是首要措施。如果这些控制由一个单一的计划者来推行，很显然，“择业自由”的承诺就是空头支票。</p>\n<p>如果计划者只是规定就业条件，通过调节这些条件来影响就业人数，情况也不会更好。通过规定报酬，计划者能有效地阻止个人进入许多行业。</p>\n<p>在一个竞争性的社会中，那些明显不胜任或不合适的人（例如一个身体羸弱却十分向往强体力工作的男孩），未必一定会被拒之门外。如果特别想要这个职位，他们常常能够用一种经济上的牺牲来得到入门的机会。但要是计划者强行规定了整个门类的报酬，这些人将得不到雇佣。</p>\n<p>为了简化工作，计划者必然会定出一套标准。原本极具多样性的人类能力和倾向，不得不被归纳为几种很容易相互交换的标准，次要的个人差别被刻意忽视。从此，个人被当作工具，为了实现所谓的“社会福利”、“社会利益”之类的抽象观念。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-6\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-6\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>在一个自由竞争的社会里，大多数事物都能以某种代价获得。这一点，成为了一些人批评自由竞争的理由，“什么高尚的价值都能和金钱交易”。</p>\n<p>首先，为别人决定什么高尚什么不高尚，不如让每个人自己决定，这才是对个人尊严的高度尊重。其次，<strong>我们必须承认，生命和健康、美和善、荣誉和宁静，凡此种种，往往都要以物质牺牲为代价才能得到</strong>。例如，如果我们愿意承担废除汽车而造成的损失，我们当然能够把车祸的伤亡减少到零。</p>\n<p>冷酷的现实通常迫使人们进行痛苦的选择，谁都不想面对这种痛苦的选择。但是，让别人来替他们进行选择，并不能缓解这种痛苦。</p>\n<p>人们希望“不再有贫困”、“物质极大丰裕”，于是不需要再做选择，这只是痴心妄想。社会主义诞生以来，“物质极大丰裕”的梦想已经说了 100 多年了，但从没有一个可执行的方案，来说明如何增加生产以便哪怕在西欧消除贫困。</p>\n<p>认为计划机制能比自由竞争生产更多的产品的观点，已经被多数学者放弃了。即便那些坚持主张计划机制的经济学家，在认真研究之后，也只是希望计划机制的效率能和自由竞争相当。他们主张计划机制，不是认为它的生产力高，而是觉得它可能带给我们更加公平的财富分配。</p>\n<p>总之，<strong>没有经济自由的政治自由是没有意义的。经济自由，是任何其他自由的前提</strong>。在经济自由下，人们自主选择、自主决定自己的经济活动，每个人在拥有选择权利的同时，也就承担了相应的风险和责任。</p>\n<h2 id=\"第八章平等与自由\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#第八章平等与自由\">#</a> 第八章：平等与自由</h2>\n<p><strong>对平等的激情，扼杀了对自由的向往</strong>。——阿克顿勋爵</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-8\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-8\">#</a> 1</h3>\n<p>反对自由竞争的观点之一是：自由竞争是“盲目的”。我想说的是，<strong>自由竞争的盲目性恰恰体现了它的正义性，因为它对于所有人都一视同仁</strong>。在自由竞争之下，我们无法预测谁会获利谁会受损，赏罚不由某个裁判员的个人好恶而定，而是取决于每个人自己的能力和运气。</p>\n<p>可供我们选择的是这两种制度，一种由几个人的意愿来决定每个人应该得到什么，另一种由每个人自己的能力和运气来决定他能得到什么。后面这种制度就是自由竞争制度。</p>\n<p>的确，自由竞争制度下，穷人的机会要比富人少。但是，即便是自由竞争社会里的穷人，也比极权社会里的富人要自由。英国的一个待遇不佳的普通工人，比德国的许多小工厂主或者俄国的高级工程师，都要自由得多，他可以自由地计划自己的生活，自由地换工作和住处，自由地发表见解，自由地以他喜欢的方式打发闲暇时光，没有任何人可以用暴力强制他做些什么。</p>\n<p><strong>在自由的社会里，穷人的致富完全掌握在自己手上，不需要依赖任何有权有势者的恩赐</strong>。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-8\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-8\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p><strong>私有产权是个人自由最重要的保障</strong>。这不单是对有产者，对无产者也一样。</p>\n<p>很多社会主义者以为，只要没收了私有的生产资料，就能带来社会平等。他们没有意识到，当把一切生产资料的所有权都移交给国家之后，国家就拥有了决定每一个人收入和地位的权力。</p>\n<p>这种权力，在一个自由竞争的社会里，谁都无法拥有。因为自由社会的生产资料分散在许许多多的雇主手里，任何一个雇主对于某个雇员的收入和地位都没有特殊的决定权，雇主必须给出有竞争力的待遇，否则没有人愿意为他干活。</p>\n<p>反之，如果所有生产资料都归由一个人掌握，无论名义上是“社会”还是独裁者，他都能对每一个人进行全面的控制。想象一下，有一位亿万富翁是我的邻居也是我的雇主，还有一位拥有国家强制力的小公务员能决定我该如何工作和生活，那么，谁对我的影响更大呢？</p>\n<p>一旦由政府承担起计划整个经济生活的任务，“谁应该得到什么”这样的经济问题就会成为政治问题，谁掌握了计划权，谁的意见就占优势。任何人想要改进自己的地位，就要设法使掌权者做出有利于他的决定。就像 19 世纪英国政治思想家警告的，“除了通过政府，没有其他道路走向富裕”。这种情况，在那些极权主义的国家里比比皆是。</p>\n<p><strong>一个富人得势的世界仍比一个只有得势才能致富的世界，要好一些</strong>。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-8\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-8\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>在俄国，“谁…谁”这个短语，是对社会主义社会里常见问题的精炼概括。谁为谁计划？谁指导和支配谁？谁规定谁的地位？谁划定谁的职责？这些问题是最高权力机关需要独自解决的核心问题。一位美国学者总结道，计划机制的政府的一切问题就是“谁得到什么，何时得到，如何得到”。</p>\n<p>计划机制下，政府将用它的权力来实现“公平”分配的理想。但是，应当按照什么原则来分配呢？有没有一个合理的价值序列呢？这个价值序列下产生的新的等级体系是否正当呢？是否真正达到了公平呢？</p>\n<p>社会主义者许诺的是“较大的平等”，但这只是对现实不满的一种表达，并没有为计划者需要解决的问题提供答案。它和“共同善”、“社会幸福”这样的词一样，没有明确的意义。</p>\n<p>在自由竞争体制下，人们说的“公道的价格”、“公平的报酬”参考的是日常惯例，也就是人们根据以往的经验得出来的合理预期。</p>\n<p>但是在计划机制下，需要由计划者来决定每种商品的“公道”价格以及产量，他还需要决定每个工种的“公平”报酬。比如，他要决定社会需要多少位建筑师、钟表匠，他还要决定建筑师、钟表匠们的“公平”报酬。</p>\n<p>在决定各种不同目标之间的相对重要性的时候，他也就决定了不同行业之间的相对重要性，以及不同个人之间的相对地位。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-8\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-8\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>当社会主义政策在实施过程中要求不同利益群体的支持时，各种冲突就会显露出来。究竟哪些东西比其他东西更重要、更有价值呢？应该把哪一套价值序列强加给所有人呢？无论如何，一个计划要想成功实施，就需要统一大家的思想。</p>\n<p>社会主义者一贯希望通过教育来统一思想。可是，知识并不能创造伦理道德标准，再多的教育，也没有办法解决调整一切社会关系所引起的道德质疑。社会主义者明白，关键不是理性说服，而是信仰传递。为此，他们创造出了很多教导工具，后来这些工具也被纳粹和法西斯主义者有效使用。</p>\n<p>德国、意大利的纳粹和法西斯主义者，并不需要发明太多东西。他们那种渗透到生活方方面面的政治运动的做法，社会主义者早就用过了。比如说，政党把成员的一切活动都纳入管制，指导从摇篮到坟墓的每一件事，把一切问题都看作政党的世界观问题。一位奥地利作家很自豪地说：“奥地利社会主义的鲜明特点，就是为工人、雇员每一方面的活动都建立了专门的组织。”</p>\n<p>奥地利之外的其他地方也差不多。第一个把儿童吸纳入政治组织的，是社会主义者；第一个采用专门的敬礼和称呼，以使党员区别于其他人的，也是社会主义者；第一个为组织设计专门制服、引入军事化编制的，还是社会主义者。也正是他们，用组织的“细胞”长期监督私人生活，创造了极权政党的原型。德国、意大利的纳粹和法西斯，只是对社会主义者已有的做法进行模仿而已。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-7\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-7\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>社会主义理论把社会划分成资本家和产业工人两个阶级，它们既有共同的利益，又互相冲突。社会主义认为老的中产阶级会迅速消失，但完全没有料到一个新的中产阶级的兴起，包括无数的职员和打字员，行政工作者和学校教师，小本经营者和小公务员等。</p>\n<p>曾经，这个中产阶级中经常诞生工人运动的领袖。然而，随着时间的推移，产业工人阶级的地位日益改善，中产阶级的地位却日益糟糕。于是，之前的社会主义理想就不再能打动中产阶级了，他们希望按照他们自己的公平观念来分配财富，从这个意义上看，他们本质上也是社会主义者，只是主张的分配方式和其他社会主义者有冲突。</p>\n<p>显然，社会主义政党这种“改善某个利益群体的经济地位”的手段，能获取该群体的支持，但无法获取所有人的支持。一定会出现一些和他们竞争的其他社会主义政党，这些政党拥有另外一些群体的支持。</p>\n<p>比如，在意大利和德国，当工人运动催生了工人特权群体之后，法西斯和纳粹则发起了对工人特权群体的反抗，他们代表的是一种新的无特权群体，这个群体主要由落魄的自由职业者构成，包括受过大学教育的工程师、律师、白领职员，他们当时的生活比工会里普通的产业工人更贫困。</p>\n<p>这些政党之间的矛盾，其实是不同的社会主义派系之间的矛盾，因为他们都主张由国家来分配每个人在社会中的地位，只是他们永远也无法就分配方案达成一致。</p>\n<h2 id=\"第九章保障与自由\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#第九章保障与自由\">#</a> 第九章：保障与自由</h2>\n<p>如果国家是唯一的雇主，反抗就等于慢慢饿死。“不劳动者不得食”这个古老原则，已被“不服从者不得食”的新原则代替。——托洛茨基，1937</p>\n<p>经济保障往往被看成真正自由不可或缺的条件。的确，无法通过自身奋斗找到前途，就很难保持思想独立和个性坚强。但“经济保障”这个概念非常含糊，需要澄清。</p>\n<p>我们先来对比两种保障，一种是所有人都可享有的、有限的保障；另一种是绝对的保障，在自由社会里只能作为特权给予像法官这样的特定群体，以便保证他们至高无上的独立性。第一种保障是为了防止严重的物资匮乏；第二种是某种生活水准或相对地位的保障。第一种保障可以面向所有人，是在市场以外、对市场体系的补充；第二种只面向少部分人，提供的保障必须通过控制或废除市场机制才能达成。</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-9\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#1-9\">#</a> 1</h3>\n<p>对于我们这种已经普遍富裕的社会，第一种保障并不会危及普遍的自由，难点在于这种保障该做到什么程度，以及依赖这种保障的人是否应该享受和自食其力的人完全同等的自由，对这些问题处理得不够谨慎可能会造成严重的政治问题。但整体而言，为所有人提供维持健康和工作能力所必需的食物、住所和衣物并没有什么争议，许多英国人已经享受了这些保障。</p>\n<p>政府也没有理由不帮助个人应对自然灾害或生活中的意外伤害（如疾病或事故）。由于这些事件的不确定性，很少人能够提前做好充分的准备。政府在这些领域提供的协助，并不会减少人们为预防这些事件的自我努力。所以，要求政府协助提供社会保险的理由是非常充分的。尽管在哪些服务该由竞争体系提供，以及社会保险是否会降低竞争有效性等方面，还有一些争议，但在原则上，由政府提供更多社会保险并不会和维护个人自由相冲突。</p>\n<p>最后，当下最迫切的问题是应对经济周期波动以及伴随而来的大规模失业。很多经济学家希望用货币政策来应对，货币政策和自由主义是完全兼容的。但也有些经济学家主张适时投入大规模公共工程，这种尝试我们必须非常谨慎，因为这会严重限制竞争范围，可能会导致经济活动越来越受政府支出的方向和数量的影响。在我看来，公共工程既非唯一，也非最有效的应对严重经济危机的方法。但不管怎么说，为应对经济波动所做的必要努力并不会危及自由。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-9\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-9\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>对自由造成隐性伤害的是另一种保障——收入保障，它确保人们的收入不会下降，而收入下降是竞争社会中的正常现象。一个行业的收入水平，应该由这个行业对社会其他成员的价值决定，对收入进行保障将导致报酬脱离实际价值。</p>\n<p>的确，环境变化有时会使某些行业或技能突然失去价值，比如一些社会价值巨大的发明，可能使某些人辛苦习得的技能突然变得一文不值。过去一百年里，这种悲剧一再发生，成千上万人因为自己无法控制的原因而遭受收入剧降的痛苦。因此，各地政府都给这些人们提供了同情和帮助。这种帮助往往不止是让他们免于贫困，而是要维持他们先前的收入水平，使他们免受市场波动的影响。</p>\n<p>由于无法预测和控制的环境变化，有些技能的社会价值降低了，有些技能的社会价值升高了。如果前者的收入不因此减少，后者的收入不因此增加，那么工作的报酬就会和它的实际价值失去关联。人们的收入将不得不由当局的主观判断来决定，很快就会出现同工不同酬的局面，收入的差异也不再能对社会就业进行指引。</p>\n<p>如果劳动力在不同行业里的分布，无法通过报酬变化这种“奖惩“机制来调整，那就只能由政府直接发出指令。既然个人的收入由政府保障，他就无法只根据自己的喜好来决定从事或放弃某份工作；既然个人工作变动带来的利益或损失不再由个人承担，对他工作调整的决定就只能由控制收入分配的人来作出。所以说，收入保障和自由择业之间是互相冲突的，人们获取了恒定的收入，就失去了择业的自由。</p>\n<p>报酬可变这种奖惩机制不但有助于激励人们努力工作，更重要的是，它给了人们一种容易理解的工具去衡量各种职业的社会重要性，帮助他们判断和选择该做什么。如果报酬和对社会的价值之间没有关联的话，主观意愿再好的个人也无法作出明智选择。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-9\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-9\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>对绝大多数人而言，如果自身利益和努力程度无关，是很难长期努力工作的。所以，报酬恒定的计划机制下，维持纪律将成为一个挑战。一位对政府计划有丰富经验的美国工程师解释道：“要进行一项工程，必须既能够从外部挑选工人，也能够开除不合格的工人。否则就只能像管理奴隶那样靠皮鞭维持纪律了”。</p>\n<p>报酬恒定的计划机制下，对管理疏忽的处罚也有同样严重的问题。有句话说得好：“<strong>竞争经济的最后手段是法警，而计划经济的最后制裁是绞刑官</strong>。”在计划机制下，和工人的情况一样，厂长的职位和收入也无法仅仅由他的工作成败决定。他不能根据自己的判断，而只能根据给定的规章来做决策。一个“应该避免”的错误没能避免，这不是个人的问题而是对社会的罪行，会得到相应“惩治”。如果平稳履行职责，他可能比资本主义的企业家收入更稳定，但如果把事情搞砸了，他要面对的危险可能比破产还严重。只要上级满意，他在经济上就有保障，但这种保障需要以自由和生命的风险为代价。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-9\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-9\">#</a>

5</h3>\n<p>很难想象习惯自由的人们会真心愿意用自由换取保障。但到处在奉行的不时给这个群体或那个群体保障特权的政策，正迅速地使人们渴望保障更甚于热爱自由。每次把保障特权赐予某个群体，其余人的不安全感就会增加，对保障的渴望也会增加。如果你承诺从一块尺寸在变化的蛋糕中分出固定大小给某些群体的话，那么剩余蛋糕的尺寸波动幅度就更大了。</p>\n<p>要保障特定行业的收入水平，唯一的办法是限制行业产量以维持高价，这必然意味着行业对外开放的机会将减少。如果某个行业受到保护，不需要再面对潜在进入者的低价竞争，那些潜在进入者的境地就变差了。任何行业对进入自由的限制，都意味着对行业外所有人的保障减少了。得到保护的行业越多，行业以外收入受损的人的就业机会就越少。在过去数十年间，正是各种争取保障的手段导致了大量人口失业和失去保障。</p>\n<p>被摒弃于保障以外的绝望者和有保障的幸运儿之间，隔着天堑鸿沟，后者由于无人竞争，根本没必要为前者做任何退让。由于自认为他们的“生活水准”、“合理收入”理应受到保护，这些幸运儿们并不愿意减少收入或牺牲部分福利来分担别人的不幸。结果虽然特定价格、个人收入稳定了，但是就业和生产都会剧烈波动。</p>\n<p>管制竞争，造成了优势地位的生产者对弱小不幸的生产者的剥削，其恶劣和残酷程度超过了任何阶级对另一个阶级的剥削。没有什么口号比“稳定”特定价格（或工资收入）带来的伤害更大了，一部分人越有保障，另一部分人就越朝不保夕。</p>\n<p>随着保障特权的增加，原本自由竞争为人们提供的最重要的保护伞——多样化的机会——越来越少，而理想中那“普遍而公平”的保障也并未实现。真实世界里，保障特权被非常零乱、重复地授予某些群体，那些受到冷落的群体的不安全感日渐升高。最终，这种特权的价值越来越高，对它的需求也越来越紧迫，以致于人们愿意为这种特权付出任何代价，甚至放弃自由也在所不惜。</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-2\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#6-2\">#</a>

100 个人被视为荣耀而雇佣 100 个人却被称为剥削。</p>\n<p>尽管强制力量不一定能够消除所有的自由精神，但倘若只有当国家公职人员才能获得荣誉和地位；倘若从事指定工作比发挥个人所长能得到更多赞美；倘若除了在官僚体系中取得地位和收入保障外，其它成就都显得低人一等；那么，要人们选择自由而非保障就实在是强人所难了。一旦事态发展到需要牺牲几乎所有美好的东西才能换取自由，自由就成了笑柄。越来越多的人会感觉到，没有经济保障的自由“不值得拥有”，这正是诱劝德国人民放弃自由的最好说辞。</p>\n<p>毫无疑问，政策应该提供免于穷困的基本保障，但为了不伤及个人自由，这种保障只能在市场以外提供，不能让市场内的竞争机制受到阻碍。基本保障对维护自由的确必不可少的，但与此同时，我们决不能忽视当前危害极大的“以自由换取保障”的风尚。</p>\n<p>我们应该认清这一事实：自由是有代价的，有时需要作出重大的物质牺牲才能维护自由。如果我们希望保有自由，就必须时刻记住富兰克林的箴言：“<strong>那些愿意放弃基本自由来换取暂时保障的人，既得不到自由，也得不到保障</strong>。”</p>\n<h2

150  年之久，但一战之前并没有产生特别大的影响。那么，后来是什么推动这股思潮得到大多数德国人（特别是全体德国年轻人）的支持呢？实际上，并不像是很多人以为的那样——那些“反动的资产阶级”在推动，恰恰相反，这些观点的力量源自集体主义。</p>\n<p>指导德国上一代统治者的学说，并不反对马克思主义里的社会主义，而是反对其包含的自由主义、国际主义和民主思想的因素，因为这些因素成为了实现社会主义的障碍。于是，左翼社会主义者日渐靠近右翼社会主义者，最后，左右翼的反资本主义势力联合起来，激进与保守的社会主义并肩将一切自由主义的东西从德国赶了出去。</p>\n<p>在社会主义指导德国劳工运动时期，极权主义和民族主义一度隐入幕后。但为时不久，1914  年以后，劳动者和理想主义青年被领进纳粹主义阵营。自此以后，纳粹主义的浪潮日渐壮大，很快发展成为希特勒的学说。1914  年德国的战败成为了纳粹主义现代发展的开端，那段时期里，纳粹主义的兴起也得到了老牌社会主义者的支持。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-12\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-12\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>老牌社会主义者的代表人物是桑巴特教授，他在整个德国境内传播社会主义思想和对资本主义的愤恨。1915  年，他出版了臭名昭著的《商人与英雄》一书。他最初是马克思派的社会主义者，直至 1909  年依然自称其将一生中的大部分时间奉献给了马克思的思想。马克思主义思想在德国之所以能深入人心，很大程度上要归功于他。</p>\n<p>桑巴特认为，“德国战争”是英国商业文明和德国英雄文化间不可避免的冲突。在他看来，仅仅追求个人的幸福是可耻的，“德国人对国家的看法”是：国家既不是由个人组建的，也不是个体的总和，国家的目的不是为任何个人的利益服务。它是一个人民共同体，在这个共同体中，人民只有义务而没有权利。个人对权利的要求是商业理想的结果。“1789 年的思想——自由，平等，博爱——是典型的商业理想，除了保证个人利益之外，没有任何其他目标。”</p>\n<p>桑巴特以德国人对战争的态度为荣。在他看来，1914  年以前，受英国影响，德国的“英雄理想”面临着致命的危险。只有战争才能让德国人想起他们是真正骁勇善战的民族，是将一切活动都从属于军事目标的民族。认为战争是不人道的和愚蠢的仅仅是一种商业观点；而有一种生活高于个人生活，那便是民族和国家的生活，个人的目标在于为了这种更高的生活而牺牲自己。战争是英雄主义人生观的顶点。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-12\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-12\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>桑巴特的观点连当时的大多数德国人都认为过于极端了，另一位保有同样思想但形式上更为温和的是德国教授约翰·普伦格。与桑巴特一样，他也是研究马克思的权威，他起初所抱持的信仰确实具有真正的社会主义性质。</p>\n<p>普伦格教授在战时出版了许多作品，其中影响最大的是《1789 年和 1914 年：政治思想史中的象征年代》，这本书专门讨论了 1789  年自由思想和 1914  年组织思想之间的冲突。普伦格认为，组织思想是社会主义的本质，而德国最好的理解和体现了组织思想。他还认为，社会主义和组织代表着 19  世纪以来先进经济生活的新生力量，英德之战实质上是自由思想和组织思想之间的冲突，这与宗教改革、资产阶级自由革命具有同等的重要性。在他笔下，这场“经济世界大战“是近代史上发生在精神斗争领域的第三个纪元。</p>\n<p>一开始，普伦格试图通过个人对整体的自愿服从，将自由的理想和组织的理想调和在一起。但很快，这些自由主义的思想痕迹便从他的著作中消失了。到了 1918 年，他关于社会主义必须与强权政治相结合的想法已经成型。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-12\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-12\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>普伦格的观念或许来源于特定圈子的科学家与工程师们，他的学说阐述得非常清晰，因而在这个圈子内颇为流行。他们叫嚣着生活中各方面都应该有集中计划的组织，其中颇具声望的代表人物是著名化学家奥斯瓦德。他曾公开宣称：“德国要把至今尚缺乏组织的欧洲组织起来，日耳曼民族已经发现了组织的意义。其他民族依然生活在个人主义体制内，而我们已经获得了有组织的制度。”</p>\n<p>将这些思想充分发展并广为传播的是一位积极的社会主义政治家，德国议会社会民主党的左翼人物保罗·伦施。他最著名的战时著作是《世界革命的三年》。从伦施的马克思主义观点来看，工业的集中化管理和企业联盟是工业发展的较高形式，相比其他国家，德国代表着更先进的经济制度。他认为，人们的自由主义、民主主义的概念都来自于英国的个人主义观点，需要被淘汰；在当前的世界革命中，德国代表着革命的一面而英国则代表着反革命的一面，作为“被历史选定的代表”，德国应当坚决“抵御外侮”，完成革命全球的历史使命。</p>\n<p>伦施谈到，对资本的组织工作，战前已经在无意识地进行，战争期间得以有意识地实施，在战后还将被系统化地继续。反对这一趋势的只有那些自由主义者。继此之后，伦施又发表了一种令人深思的观点，该观点包含了许多事实因素：由于社会主义劳工 50 年来的艰苦奋斗，国家已不再是 1867  年普选刚开始时的样子，社会主义也不再是当年的社会民主主义了。国家经历了社会主义化的过程，而社会民主主义则经历了国家化的过程。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-11\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-11\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>普伦格和伦施先后为纳粹主义直接领导人提供了指导思想，其中最有名的两位分别是施本格勒和缪勒·范·登·布鲁克。</p>\n<p>施本格勒认为旧时的普鲁士精神与社会主义信念同出一辙，而所有自由主义改良派则都是“英式的”，这种“英式的”精神将被从德国革命中驱逐出去。他说：“普鲁士人的本能是：权力属于整体……每个人都被安排了位置，一个人要么命令他人，要么服从他人。这便是 18  世纪以来的专制社会主义，其本质是反自由主义和反民主主义的……英国民族的结构建立在贫富差别上，普鲁士民族的结构建立在命令与服从的区别上，两国的阶级区别的意义有本质的不同。”他还指出：“严格意义上讲，私人是不能存在的，体制如钟表机械装置一样精准地运转，每个人就是其中的一个环节。”</p>\n<p>“普鲁士观念”要求每个人都应成为国家公务员，一切薪水全由国家规定，未来的国家应该是官僚制的。作为纳粹主义的早期领导者，缪勒·范·登·布鲁克宣称，一战是自由主义与社会主义之间的战争，战争的失败是反西方的失败，是社会主义反自由主义的失败。同施本格勒看法一致，他也将自由主义看作头号敌人。</p>\n<p>反对任何形式的自由主义，反对打败德国的自由主义，这将社会主义者和保守主义者联合成了统一阵线。这种思想最初在极具社会主义精神的“德国青年运动”中被接受，并完成了社会主义和民族主义的融合。</p>\n<p>二十年代后期到希特勒上台之前，一批年轻人在费迪南德·弗里德的领导下成为了这种思想在知识界的主要拥护者，他们在德国被称为“高尚的纳粹”，弗里德的《资本主义的末日》可能是他们最具代表性的产物。令人感到不安的是，今天我们在英美也能见到这样的文学作品，它们把左右翼的社会主义者联合起来，反对一切原有意义上的自由主义。大批作者使用“保守社会主义”或“宗教社会主义”的口号摇旗呐喊，在今天的英国，这俨然已经成为一种主导倾向。</p>\n<h2

年，我们就会清晰地看到英国沿着德国的道路走了多远。当年，英国人曾经对自己独特的自由主义传统无比自豪；现今，大多数英国人却对英国特有的政治观点尤感惭愧。</p>\n<p>德国著作中阐明过各种可怕观点，譬如“工业生活的军事化”、“个人主义必须寿终正寝”、“必须建立起一个管理制度，其目的不是增进个人幸福，而是要加强国家的有组织的统一，以求达到最高限度的效能”。如今，类似的观点也出现在了英国的文献中。在英国，为极权主义开辟道路的著作往往都岀自那些声名显赫的理想主义知识分子。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-13\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-13\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>接下来，我们以天才学者 E·H·卡尔教授的《二十年的危机》与《和平的条件》为例，看看英国著作中如何弥漫着各种极权主义。</p>\n<p>卡尔教授赞同，“使道德成为政治的一种功能”，且 “除了事实的标准外，不能合乎逻辑地接受任何价值标准”，即道德及道德的  “抽象的一般原则”都必须被消除。可是常理告诉我们，如果没有抽象的一般原则，是非标准就只能是一种任意、武断的意见；如果没有道德的约束，一切的国际条约都会失去任何意义。</p>\n<p>卡尔教授设计的未来社会是以极权主义为模型的。在其著作《和平的条件》中，他把纳粹德国的战争叫嚣作为自己的口号，反对自由主义民主政治、民族自决和自由放任的经济，并鼓吹建立集中计划和管制的世界是不可避免的发展方向。而这种“不可避免的”宿命论却是基于一个经济学谬论——技术的发展必然引起垄断组织的普遍发展。不过，卡尔教授的经济学观点经不起任何认真审慎的检验。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-13\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-13\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>科学家们鼓吹将社会“科学地”组织起来，是近百年来德国思想发展的特点之一。凭借科学家、技术专家们对社会和政治见解的特殊影响力，这一理想已经在德国大力推进，如今也出现在了英语国家中。</p>\n<p>这些披着科学家外衣的政治家们很少支持自由主义。科学家、技术专家们往往明显地表现出对理性的不容忍、对平常人做事方式的不耐心，并轻视一切未由超凡头脑依照科学蓝图有意识地组织起来的事物。1840 年至 1940 年期间，德国的教育制度从“人文”之学普遍彻底地转向“现实”之学，这极大地推动了德国的极权体制发展。</p>\n<p>德国的大部分学者和科学家都欣然委身于新的统治者，在极权主义的社会改造中推波助澜。</p>\n<p>法国哲学家朱利思·本达在他 15 年前的著作《知识分子的背叛》一书中已经预见这一情况，并特别指出那些主张专制权力的人往往会刻意宣传“历史服从于科学的规律”这一教条。</p>\n<p>英国著名生物学家  C·H·沃丁顿博士所写的《科学的态度》一书得到了有广泛影响力的英国《自然》周刊的大力推荐。该类著作极力主张赋予科学家更大的政治权力，热烈鼓吹大规模的“计划化”。沃丁顿博士依据“科学能够对人的行为作出道德的判断”这一论述提岀了“科学家有资格经营一个极权主义社会”的主张。同时，书里论述的社会和经济问题毫无科学可言，引证论点的论据都来自一些有科学问题的政治性小册子，缺乏严肃的科学研究。令人惊讶的是，他竟然期盼着集中化的极权体制和自由的思想并存。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-13\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-13\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>在政治运动中，垄断企业资本家是组织者也是策划者，他们幻想能长久享有优越地位。然而，即便国家容许这样的权力集合体成长起来，也不会让这种权力完全控制在私人手中。当私人工业和国家工业并存时，出色的产业人才虽然有可能在比较安稳的位置上得到高额薪水，但他们不再享有主人的权利，仅能接受政府给予的权力和报酬。</p>\n<p>通过分享利润或游说他人相信垄断符合公众利益，垄断企业资本家成功地获得了愈来愈多的利益集团和政府的支持。甚嚣尘上的舆论影响着立法和司法程序，成为这种发展的重要催化剂。另一方面，各种反对垄断的措施常常反倒加强了垄断的权力。因为对垄断利润的每一次袭击，都容易产生新的既得利益，并助力垄断的扩张。</p>\n<p>当垄断无法避免，控制垄断风险的最好方法绝对不是由政府来掌握。如果涉及许多不同产业，宁可让这些局部的垄断分散在不同个人的手中，而不要统一交由政府管理。因为私人垄断很少是完全的、长期的垄断，往往还存在着潜在竞争；而国家的垄断则受到国家保护，可以免于潜在竞争和有效批评，这种情况下，批评垄断容易被解读为批评政府。</p>\n<p>相较由政府直接搞经营，美国人往往会釆取对私人垄断加强政府管制。政府可以实施严格的价格管制使垄断没有特殊利润，并使垄断者以外的其他人也能分享利润。这样的话，即便垄断行业提供的服务不能达到最优，抑制垄断所付出的代价也比较有限。这种管理垄断的方法有助于把垄断限制在不可避免的范围内，并鼓励发明和提供竞争替代品，因而更可能收到良好效果。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-12\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-12\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>造成垄断需要多重因素，不是仅靠少数有利害关系的资本家就能单独完成，他们需要多方支持。垄断资本家通过分享收益或各处游说，使得人们相信垄断有助于建立公平良序的社会。</p>\n<p>近些年的垄断大多是由有组织的资方和有组织的劳工精心合作的结果。在反竞争学说的影响下，劳工运动的目的从和一切特权做斗争转为争取特权。当劳工中的特权集团分享了垄断利润时，普通大众，特别是境况较差的工业组织中的工人和失业者，就成为了牺牲品。</p>\n<p>看到一个伟大的民主运动正在支持一种必定会导致民主毁灭的政策，且仅对少数人有利，这无疑是这个时代最令人痛心的一幕。那些大声宣布“一劳永逸地铲除疯狂的竞争制度”的劳工领袖们，正在宣布个人自由的毁灭。在摧毁市场规律形成的秩序的同时，建立了由少数人的意志指导的新秩序。在这种新秩序里，只有少数人能获益，大多数人的个人自由将受到损害。</p>\n<p>英国工党致力于建立一个“有计划的社会”，细看一下他们的新纲领就会发现，这个以反对“任何恢复传统的不列颠的企图”为目的的方案，在架构轮廓和细节上，甚至在措词方面，都和 25 年前主导德国舆论的社会主义梦想一致。</p>\n<p>“一个有计划的社会能够比自由竞争制度下的社会更加自由”，这种天真想法放在 25 年前或许还情有可原，但在经历了 25 年的实践经验、对这些观念的再认识、与极权国家的战争之后，竟然在英国还被提倡就令人不由得感到悲哀了。</p>\n<h2 id=\"第十四章物质条件与道德理想\"><a class=\"anchor\"

1</h3>\n<p>社会改造都要考虑经济因素。如今，人们的信念受到各种精心培养和刻意鼓吹的虚假经济学说的影响。被“洗脑”的人们会把诸如销毁积存原料或压制新发明等各种罪责都归咎于竞争，但实际上这些只会发生在垄断之下，特别是在政府支持的垄断之下。</p>\n<p>我们这代人普遍地憎恨并反抗那些非人为的力量（译者注：这里的非人为力量指自发的市场秩序、生物自然进化等“看不见的手”的力量），不愿屈从任何规则或不明其所以然的任何要求。随着环境变得越来越复杂，人们对于那些不了解的、妨碍个人希望和计划的力量日益抗拒，进而变得越来越无法去充分地了解这些力量。人们往往会把一切过失都简单地归咎于一个显而易见的、直接的、可以避免的原因，完全无视那些导致变化的更为复杂的关联因素。</p>\n<p>回看历史的长河，人类文明之所以能够成长壮大，正是因为顺应了非人为力量。正因如此，人们才能协力筑造非个人能够充分理解的伟大事物，才能理性地去了解并顺应那些未知力量。抗拒未知力量是一种不完全的、错误的唯理主义产物。在一个复杂的社会里，若要协调多种多样的个人努力，就必须认识到个人无法全知全察。</p>\n<p>有些人认为我们必须学会像驾驭自然力量那样去驾驭社会力量。然而，这条路最终会通向极权主义，阻碍未来进步，导致我们文明的毁灭。提出这样的要求恰恰证明，这些人不了解非人为力量对个人努力所起的协调作用。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-14\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-14\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>在战争和重大灾难发生时，为了保障长久的自由，人们可能会暂时牺牲眼前的自由。但是，在和平时期，不应容许任何单一的目的绝对凌驾于其它目的之上。即便是当务之急的保障就业的目标，也不能“不惜一切代价”，不管不顾其它目标。否则，由此引致的鼠目寸光的措施，以及不分好歹不负责任的思潮，将造成更大的危害。</p>\n<p>随着社会环境由战争状态回归到和平正常化状态，战争期间安排到特殊专业化高薪岗位上的几十万人将有大批人员面临转业和随之而来的降薪。</p>\n<p>如果工会不接受降薪，坚持要保障这些人原有的薪水水平，这将导致他们的失业。如果我们要不惜一切代价地既保薪水又保就业，那就会严重影响生产性资源的最佳调配。需要注意的是，就算实施货币政策也不能真正解决这个问题，而且还会引发大规模通货膨胀，从而隐而不宣地间接普降实际工资。极度的通货膨胀所造成的社会动荡、困苦和不公正等弊端将远超所要解决的问题本身。</p>\n<p>维持原有岗位或者实施货币扩张政策，都有可能短期内保持较高的就业水平，但是，这无法阻拦必要的劳动力再分配。只要工人可以自由择业，劳动力的再分配就会发生，失业也就不可避免。用货币手段实现的高就业水平会降低劳动生产率，最终依然影响薪水水平和就业率。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-14\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-14\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>战后，我们在管理经济事务方面需要更高的智慧，我们文明的最终命运也将取决于我们如何解决面临的一切经济问题。我们不应短视地仅通过收入再分配的办法去救治贫困，而应扩充增加收入的途径。</p>\n<p>我们必须把希望寄托在恢复经济快速增长上。不管起点多低，增长将不断地把我们的生活水平推高。如果我们想要恢复甚至超越以往的水平，我们就必须作岀大幅调整。在确保每个人都享有统一的最低的福利保障水准的同时，个别阶层必须放弃其特权要求。</p>\n<p>有些人承认现在的政治倾向威胁了我们的经济前景，但还自欺欺人地自我安慰，声称我们正在为实现理想目标而做出物质牺牲。然而，过去 50 年集体主义的发展并没有提升民众的道德水平，现在的我们比先辈更加愤恨社会秩序的不平等。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-14\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-14\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>当物质环境迫使我们进行选择时，个人有决定自己行动的自由，并依照自己的良心安排自己的生活。只有当我们能对自己的利害关系负责，并且有牺牲它们的自由时，我们的决定才具有道德价值。我们没有权利以他人的利益为代价来博取自己无私的美名，另外，我们要是在没有选择自由的情况下做到了无私，这也谈不上道德。</p>\n<p>现在较少得到尊重和守持的美德，诸如，独立、自力更生、甘愿担当风险、坚持自己的信仰、和邻人自愿地合作，这些实质上都是个人主义社会据以运作的基础。但集体主义消灭了这些美德，强迫要求个人服从于集体认为好的事情。在集体主义的作用下，个人扭转不平等现象的责任感被削弱，个人担当责任的意愿也受到损害。</p>\n<p>自由与独立、真理与诚笃、和平与民主、把个人作为人而不仅作为一个有组织的集团中的一员来尊重——这些都是道德价值。而现在，社会保障的是封闭型集团成员的特殊权利，这是对非成员的歧视。政府为了某些集团的利益而强加于个人的不公正行动，是对基本人权的粗暴践踏，但民众们竟然都熟视无睹，这确凿地表明我们社会的道义感已变得非常迟钝。</p>\n<h3

5</h3>\n<p>英国人理应引以为傲的道德精华，诸如，独立和自力更生、个人独创性和地方自治、自愿活动、不干涉邻人事务和宽容异端、尊重风俗习惯和传统、对权力和权威的适度怀疑，这些形成了英国的民族性和整个道德精神的传统和制度，然而目前正在被集权主义倾向不断地毁灭着。</p>\n<p>从德国人惨痛的经历里，我们应该懂得：在一个摧残人身自由和个人责任的制度里，无论是善意的动机，还是高效率的组织方式，都不足以使人安身立命。</p>\n<p>如果我们要在思想战争中取得胜利，我们必须恢复对以往所维护的那些英国传统价值的信心，必须在道义上有勇气去坚定地维护我们敌人所攻击的那些理想。</p>\n<h2

世纪自由主义淡出国际关系领域，世界已经为之付出昂贵代价。然而遗憾的是，英国没能很好地吸取经验教训。在这个领域，那些令人向往和正在践行的流行观念带来的结果往往与其预示的大相径庭。</p>\n<p>人们渐渐明白，许多全国规模的独立经济计划无论从总体上还是纯经济的观点来看，都是有害的，也必将引起国际摩擦。如果每个国家的举措都只从自身利益出发，不惜损害他国的利益，国际秩序和持久和平就没有希望。</p>\n<p>很多经济计划只有在当局有效阻断外来影响的前提下才能得以实施，因此，计划体制的结果必然是对人员和货物的流通限制愈来愈多。</p>\n<p>如果资源被各国独占，国际经济关系由个人升级为作为贸易实体的国家间的关系，各国的不和和猜忌将无法避免。那么在没有更高法律约束的情况下，各国间的经济交易必定会导致权力的冲突，甚至诉诸武力。</p>\n<p>如果不利用好战争胜利的形势，任由这样下去，我们会发现我们打败了一个德国，但却建成了许多德国一样的国家组成的世界，德国只不过是“出头鸟”罢了。</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-15\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#2-15\">#</a> 2</h3>\n<p>一部分人提出建立“国际性”的经济计划，提议通过超国家主管机构来避免国家计划体制带来的危险。这是一个危险的提议，他们没考虑到，随着计划规模的扩大，一致看法会日益减少，借助强力和强制的必要性将逐渐增大。</p>\n<p>大多数人愿意帮助别人解决问题，他们相信自己有能力做到公平公正。他们想象可以通过民主程序来管理和计划一个多国家的广大地区的经济生活。然而他们不了解的是，这样的国际性计划等同于赤裸裸的强力统治，正如德国对待弱小民族那样。</p>\n<p>不能把德国的行为简单地归咎于它的邪恶，即使是心地最善良的人，要管理理想和价值标准差异很大的人民的经济生活，也难免要使用极不道德的手段。在这一点上，英国也不会例外。</p>\n<p>有人认为，把决定权交给“人民”，各国工人阶级利益的一致性就会克服在各国统治阶级里存在的分歧。这完全是一种错觉。很有可能，在实行世界性计划体制时，国内的经济利益冲突会以更激烈的形式蔓延到整个世界，导致各国之间不得不诉诸武力。</p>\n<p>可以肯定，富裕而强大的国家会成为贫困国家仇恨和猜忌的对象，后者会认为只要他们能自由地做他们想做的事，就能很快改善处境。国与国之间的公平分配问题，必将导致各国工人阶级之间的争斗。</p>\n<p>制定这种计划必须要考虑好各种需求的优先顺序。但是大多数人会认为，被他人代为选定的某种特定优先顺序是极不公平的，从而会向决定他们命运的强国发泄他们的仇恨。无论处理这件事的人有多公正，当他们遭到反抗的时候，他们可能会第一个动用强力，表现得残酷无情。</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-15\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#3-15\">#</a> 3</h3>\n<p>一些现实主义者们相信，实行国际经济计划会比建立国际政治秩序更加切实可行。事实将告诉他们，一旦各国将经济权力交给一个国际性主管机构，不久他们就会发现，他们委托的绝不仅仅是一个技术任务，而是管理他们生活的最广泛的权力。</p>\n<p>有人建议只把特定的经济权力委托给国际性主管机构，这个想法也是有问题的。任何不受更高权力约束的国际机构，即使在某个特定领域，也很容易施展其最暴虐、最不负责任的权力。</p>\n<p>比如那些有意识地控制和分配主要原料之类的建议，它们将产生可怕的政治困难和道德危害。因为一旦得不到原料控制者的准许，新的行业和企业将不会产生。任何发展和改进计划都无法躲过原料控制者所拥有的极具破坏力的否决权。更不用说国际市场分配、投资控制和自然资源开发了。</p>\n<p>不管大国小国，如果在国际上获得不受限制的主权，那就别指望战后秩序和持久和平。我们不能把一项在一国内都还没学会妥善使用的权力赋予一个新的超级国家，让他们指导各国如何使用资源。我们真正需要的是一种可以制止伤害他国行为的权力，我们需要一套规则来规定一个国家可以做什么，并为此设立一个主管机构。</p>\n<p>这并不是要把很多权力集中在不负责任的国际经济机构手里，而是要赋予它更高的政治权力去制衡各种经济利益集团。因为它不参与经济角逐，所以它能够真正保持公平。它无权指挥各国如何行动，但可以制止他们损害他国的行为。它所拥有的是一种可以维持和平关系的最低限度的权力，几乎等同于那种极度自由主义的“自由放任”国家所拥有的权力。最重要的是，这种权力要在法治的约束之下。</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-15\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-15\">#</a> 4</h3>\n<p>我们可以考虑采用联邦制的形式，这是指在一种国际政府形式下，把某些严格规定的权力移交给国际机构，同时，仍由各国继续负责各自的国内事务。这是既能联合不同国家又不影响各国独立意愿的唯一治理形式。联邦制其实是把国内民主政治运用到了国际事务领域，它赋予治理机构明确和有限的权力。</p>\n<p>面对杀戮我们不能只发表反对宣言，而应该赋予主管机构制止的权力。没有实施国际法的国际权力机构，国际法就没有意义。有人担心这样的国际权力机构掌握无限的权力，这个担心是多余的，因为联邦制遵循着分权原则，通过分权限制了整体权力。</p>\n<p>联邦制的优点之一就是，它能使有害的计划难以实现，却给值得期待的计划大开方便之门。它使国际性计划只限于能达成一致意见的领域，其他领域则由更具资格的人自行负责。可以预见，在联邦内部，过去的在各国发生的集权进程将得到扭转，国家的某些权力下放给地方成为可能。</p>\n<p>把不同国家吸收进一些大的或唯一的联邦集团组织，从而实现世界和平，这并不是什么新鲜的想法。实际上，它几乎是所有 19 世纪自由主义思想家的共同理想，只是 20 世纪甚嚣尘上的“现实政治”让这个目标变成了空想。</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-14\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#5-14\">#</a> 5</h3>\n<p>整体上看，联邦下的各国，小国人民生活美好体面，大国人民日子幸福美满。这并非偶然，因为他们躲过了中央集权的致命损害。如果把大多数决定权交给一个庞大的组织独揽，对这个组织普通人将无法测度和理解，我们也将无法维护和培育民主。</p>\n<p>没有大规模地方自治，没有像培养未来领导人那样为民众提供国民教育学校，民主将很难实行。只有在人们熟悉的事务上练习和学会负起责任，只有了解身边的人的需要，而不是用关于人类需要什么的理论来指导，普通人才能真正参与公共事务。如果把政治活动的范围搞得过大，只有官僚机构才掌握有关这一政治活动的必要知识，那普通人参与的热情就会大大减弱。</p>\n<p>只有在真正的法治下，小国才可能像在国内那样在国际事务中保持独立性。设计国际机构的宪制时，既要保证这种超国家机构执行共同法所需的权力，又要防止国际和国内当局成为暴政机构。创造一个适合小国生存的世界，对我们大家都有好处。</p>\n<p>这次战争结束时，战胜国将迎来最好的机会，道义上的权力使他们有机会制定一个自己和他国都愿意服从的规则体系。</p>\n<p>一个能有效阻止国家控制其国民的国际机构，是对和平的最好保障。国际范围内的法治必须保障国家不对个人、超级国家不对各个国家实施暴政。我们的目标既不是无限权力的超级国家，也不是“自由国家”的散漫联合体，而必须是自由人的国家组成的共同体。</p>\n<p>只要善加运用，联邦制组织原则会是世界性问题的最佳解决方案。</p>\n<p>不过，这个原则的运用并不容易。如果我们过于雄心勃勃，想把所有新的国际组织都搞成全方位的、世界规模的组织，那将很难成功。在我看来，文化、看法和标准上都更近似的国家之间，可以成立更紧密的联盟，这种更小的、更紧密的联盟也许会成为维护和平的更有效工具。当然，我们依然需要一个更大的、较为松散的联合体。这两件事之间并不矛盾。</p>\n<h2
